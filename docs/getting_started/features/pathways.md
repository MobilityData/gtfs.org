#  Pathways
Pathways contains features that allow to model large transit stations, helping riders navigate from station entrances and exists to the location where they board or disambark from a transit vehicle. Some of these features make it possible to communicate a path's physical characteristics and estimated navigation time, and real-world wayfinding systems employed in stations.

## Location types

Location types are used to classify key areas within transit stations such as exits/entrances, nodes or boarding areas, as well as their relationship. Location types serve as a fundation for modeling transit stations using Pathways.

## Pathway connections

At its foundational level, Pathways offers basic functionality to connect key areas defined in Location types within a station. These connections form pathways, enabling users to obtain precise directions (e. g. from an entrance to the boarding area), which is particularly useful in navigating large and complex transit stations.

- [Location Types feature](/getting_started/features/pathways/#location-types)

## Pathways details

More details can be added to provide additional details regadring the physical characteristics of a stationâ€™s pathways, including length, width and slope (for ramps) or the number of stairs (for stairways). This helps riders anticipate the conditions and accessibility of the pathway they need to navigate.
