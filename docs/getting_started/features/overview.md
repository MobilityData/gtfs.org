# GTFS Schedule Features

As the GTFS Reference format evolves to meet the current needs of transit systems, its functions can become increasingly complex. The **GTFS Features** are intended to provide a clear and definitive explanation of functionalities enabled by the GTFS Reference format. This helps transit agencies, vendors, consumers and researchers understand the capabilities of GTFS and answer the question: **What can I do with GTFS?** 

The following groups of features explain the purpose of each feature as well as the files and fields associated with them, helping users to understand which data is needed to support a specific feature.

## Base
These essential features form the core of a GTFS feed. They are the minimal elements needed to represent a transit service.
