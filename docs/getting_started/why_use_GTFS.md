# Why Use GTFS?

GTFS is used by over 10,000 transit agencies in over 100 countries. Most transit agencies have heard of GTFS, and it has quickly become an industry standard. Some agencies produce this data themselves, while others employ a vendor to create and maintain data for them. And because it is a simple, text-based Open Standard, many transit technology vendors can already read and write to GTFS files. By better understanding GTFS, agencies can make better choices when it comes to data. The choices agencies make in how to maintain and distribute GTFS can have a huge impact on service quality. 

## Open Data means more opportunity and choices

GTFS is an Open Standard. This means that agencies can make information available using any of the many tools which already support GTFS (including simple text editing using a text editor or a spreadsheet). Open standards lead to the creation of data that can be easily shared. A feed is simply the collection of text files that describe a service, hosted online at a permalink that’s publicly available. The same feed can be used by Google, Apple, Transit App, Open Trip Planner, and even apps created by riders. Anyone who wants to provide accurate and up-to-date transit information can use a GTFS feed to do so. 

Some riders like to use different apps depending on their needs—having GTFS lets riders choose what trip planning app suits them best. Some apps may be more accessible or better at providing information for riders with disabilities, some may be simpler and easier to use, and sometimes riders just want the newest app.

## GTFS can probably do more than you think

GTFS is most widely known for trip planning information, particularly in metro areas with fixed-route service. However, there are a variety of optional features above and beyond the basic GTFS Schedule specification that make GTFS more widely applicable, including Fares for showing fare costs and structures, Flex (in development) for demand-responsive transit options, such as dial-a-ride and paratransit services, and Pathways for displaying accessibility information that’s vital to riders using mobility devices or needing additional accommodations. GTFS Realtime builds upon GTFS Schedule and on-vehicle GPS systems to provide real-time updates on vehicle locations.

## GTFS is more than just trip planning

GTFS data is now being used by a variety of software applications for many different purposes, including data visualization and analysis tools for planning. Having up-to-date and high quality data provides accurate transit information not just to riders, but to planners and policymakers who are able to better understand how transit is being used in their communities. Beginning in 2023, the United States' Federal Transit Administration will require [transit agencies there to submit valid GTFS data](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/03/03/2023-04379/national-transit-database-reporting-changes-and-clarifications) with their annual National Transit Database report.
