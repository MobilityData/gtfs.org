# Reach more riders and improve public transit with GTFS
GTFS serves as the backbone of modern transit systems, enabling agencies to provide accurate and up-to-date information to riders, app developers, and policymakers. Below, we'll explore the various benefits of GTFS and how it enhances public transit worldwide.

## Widely Used & Globally Adopted

Over 10,000 agencies in 100+ countries use GTFS, ensuring consistent data for multi-agency trips and simplifying travel across regions. Here's how GTFS facilitates global reach and seamless trips:

- **Standardized Data:** GTFS provides a standardized format for transit data, ensuring consistency across agencies and regions, simplifying travel planning for riders.
- **Multi-Agency Trips:** GTFS enables agencies to share consistent, reliable data, facilitating seamless travel experiences for riders traveling across multiple transit systems.

## Community-Driven Development and Freely Accessible

GTFS thrives on community collaboration, ensuring its continuous evolution and relevance, with a primary focus on passenger-facing information within the specification.

- **Open Collaboration:** GTFS operates as an open data standard, allowing anyone to contribute changes or improvements.
- **Guided Evolution:** The specification evolution is overseen by an independent nonprofit organization called [MobilityData](https://mobilitydata.org/), and its changes are guided by the principles of ease of use, backwards-compatibility, and pragmatic change. 
- **Community-driven Development:** The GTFS specification undergoes continuous refinement through input and review from the community, facilitated on platforms like [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Slack](https://share.mobilitydata.org/slack).

## Simple and Easy to Use

GTFS fosters collaboration between transit agencies by enabling easy data exchange, promoting smoother service integration, and information sharing. Here's how GTFS simplifies data sharing:

- **Ease of Integration:** GTFS makes it easy for agencies to get started with a simple data structure using common file formats like .txt and GeoJSON, fostering collaboration and interoperability.
- **Backwards compatible:** when updating the specification, existing feeds remain valid and maintain compatibility with existing parsers.

## GTFS can probably do more than you think

While schedule information is at its core, GTFS also offers additional features that enhance the transit experience, such as:

- **Fares:** GTFS can include fare information for accurate cost breakdowns across routes and journey options.
- **Flexible services:** GTFS can describe demand-responsive options like dial-a-ride, route deviations, and other services that do not follow the common behavior of scheduled and/or fixed service.
- **Pathways:** GTFS can model large transit stations, helping riders navigate from station entrances and exits to the location where they board or disembark from a transit vehicle.
