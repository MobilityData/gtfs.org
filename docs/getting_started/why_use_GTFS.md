# Why Use GTFS?

Over 10,000 transit agencies in 100+ countries rely on GTFS, quickly becoming an industry standard. Here's what makes it so advantageous:

- **Simple**: The core GTFS data is text-based and easy to understand. 
- **Flexible**: It also offers the possibility of plugging in additional features beyond schedules, like fare information, flexible services, and accessibility information.
- **Open Source**: by being freely available, data can be shared easily, and developers can create tools, shaping the future of GTFS to better suit their needs.
- **Community Driven**: developed collaboratively, GTFS ensures the format meets the evolving needs of riders and agencies.

## A simple standard that is accessible to everyone

Because it is a simple, text-based [Open Standard](https://www.interoperablemobility.org/definitions/#open_standard), many transit technology vendors can already read and write to GTFS files. By easily understanding GTFS, agencies can make better choices when it comes to data making its implementation easier. 

## GTFS can probably do more than you think

GTFS is mostly known for providing schedule information for public transit, particularly in metro areas with fixed-route services. However, there are optional features beyond the basic GTFS Schedule such as:

- [Fares features](/getting_started/features/fares) showing fare costs and structures; 
- [Flexible services features](/getting_started/features/flexible_services), offering demand-responsive transit options, like dial-a-ride and paratransit services; 
- [Pathways features](/getting_started/features/pathways), displaying vital accessibility information for rider navigation in stations. 
- And [many more](/getting_started/features/overview).

Additionally, GTFS data is now being used by a variety of software applications including data visualization and analysis tools for planning and research. Having up-to-date and high quality data provides accurate transit information not just to riders, but also to planners and policymakers who are able to better understand how transit is being used in their communities. 

## Open Data means more opportunity and choices

GTFS is an Open Standard. This means that agencies can make information available using any of the tools which already support GTFS (including simple text editing or a spreadsheet). Open standards lead to the creation of data that can be easily shared. The feeds can be used by trip planners such as Google, Apple, Transit App, Open Trip Planner, and even apps created by riders. Anyone who wants to provide accurate and up-to-date transit information can use GTFS feed to do so.

Some riders like to use different apps depending on their needsâ€”having GTFS lets riders choose what trip planning app suits them best. Some apps may be more accessible or better at providing information for riders with disabilities, some may be simpler and easier to use, and sometimes riders just want the newest app.

## Maintained by the community

As an open data standard, GTFS is driven by an open community where anyone can propose changes or improvements. The specification evolution is overseen by an independent nonprofit organization called [MobilityData](https://mobilitydata.org/), and its changes are guided by the following principles:

- Feeds should be easy to create and edit
- Feeds should be easy to parse
- The specification is primarily concerned with passenger information
- Changes to the specification should be backwards-compatible
- Speculative features are discouraged

The Reference documents for [GTFS Schedule](/documentation/schedule/reference/) and [GTFS Realtime](/documentation/Realtime/reference/) are officially hosted in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/transit), where changes are proposed and reviewed by the community.
