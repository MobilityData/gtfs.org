The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is an [Open Standard](https://www.interoperablemobility.org/definitions/#open_standard) used to distribute relevant information about transit systems to riders. It allows public transit agencies to publish their transit data in a format that can be consumed by a wide variety of software applications. Today, the GTFS data format is used by thousands of public transport providers.

GTFS consists of two main parts: GTFS Schedule and GTFS Realtime. GTFS Schedule contains information about routes, schedules, fares, and geographic transit details, and it is presented in simple text files. This straightforward format allows for easy creation and maintenance without relying on complex or proprietary software.

GTFS Realtime contains trip updates, vehicle positions, and service alerts. It is based on Protocol Buffers, which are a language (and platform) neutral mechanism for serializing structured data.

GTFS is supported around the world and its use, importance, and scope has been increasing. It‚Äôs likely that an agency you know already uses GTFS to represent routes, schedule, stop locations, and other information, and that riders are already consuming it via various applications.

## Why Use GTFS?

GTFS is used by over 10,000 transit agencies in over 100 countries. Most transit agencies have heard of GTFS, and it has quickly become an industry standard. Some agencies produce this data themselves, while others employ a vendor to create and maintain data for them. And because it is a simple, text-based Open Standard, many transit technology vendors can already read and write to GTFS files. By better understanding GTFS, agencies can make better choices when it comes to data. The choices agencies make in how to maintain and distribute GTFS can have a huge impact on service quality. 

### Open Data means more opportunity and choices

GTFS is an Open Standard. This means that agencies can make information available using any of the many tools which already support GTFS (including simple text editing using a text editor or a spreadsheet). Open standards lead to the creation of data that can be easily shared. A feed is simply the collection of text files that describe a service, hosted online at a permalink that‚Äôs publicly available. The same feed can be used by Google, Apple, Transit App, Open Trip Planner, and even apps created by riders. Anyone who wants to provide accurate and up-to-date transit information can use a GTFS feed to do so. 

Some riders like to use different apps depending on their needs‚Äîhaving GTFS lets riders choose what trip planning app suits them best. Some apps may be more accessible or better at providing information for riders with disabilities, some may be simpler and easier to use, and sometimes riders just want the newest app.

### GTFS can probably do more than you think

GTFS is most widely known for trip planning information, particularly in metro areas with fixed-route service. However, there are a variety of optional features above and beyond the basic GTFS Schedule specification that make GTFS more widely applicable, including Fares for showing fare costs and structures, Flex (in development) for demand-responsive transit options, such as dial-a-ride and paratransit services, and Pathways for displaying accessibility information that‚Äôs vital to riders using mobility devices or needing additional accommodations. GTFS Realtime builds upon GTFS Schedule and on-vehicle GPS systems to provide real-time updates on vehicle locations.

### GTFS is more than just trip planning

GTFS data is now being used by a variety of software applications for many different purposes, including data visualization and analysis tools for planning. Having up-to-date and high quality data provides accurate transit information not just to riders, but to planners and policymakers who are able to better understand how transit is being used in their communities. Beginning in 2023, the United States' Federal Transit Administration will require [transit agencies there to submit valid GTFS data](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/03/03/2023-04379/national-transit-database-reporting-changes-and-clarifications) with their annual National Transit Database report.

## How to create GTFS

A GTFS feed, which contains static transit information, is composed of a number of text (.txt) files that are contained in a single ZIP file. Each file describes a particular aspect of transit information: stops, routes, trips, fares, etc. For more information about each file, consult the GTFS reference. 

In order to create a GTFS feed follow the steps below.

1. Create all the required files described in the [GTFS Schedule](reference) reference. Create the optional files if their functionality is desired. 
1. Save all files in the .txt format. Field values should be comma delimited and each line should end with a line break. See the GTFS reference for detailed information on the file contents.
1. Zip all the text files together. The zipped file comprises a version of the feed.
1. Publish the feed by using one of the options below.

## What is High Quality GTFS?

High quality GTFS is complete, accurate, and up-to-date. This means that it represents how services are currently operating and provides as much information as possible.
For information on creating high quality data, see the [California Transit Data Guidelines](https://dot.ca.gov/cal-itp/california-transit-data-guidelines), the [GTFS Schedule Best Practices](https://gtfs.org/schedule/best-practices/) and the [GTFS Realtime Best Practices](https://gtfs.org/realtime/best-practices/).
For evaluating the quality of a dataset, see [Validate](https://gtfs.org/schedule/validate/) page.

### Complete Data

Quality GTFS includes important service details such as holiday and summer schedule changes, accurate stop locations, and names for routes and headsigns that match other rider-facing materials. Even if an agency works with a vendor to produce GTFS, it‚Äôs ultimately up to the agency to ensure that the information presented in print, on board, and online is consistent.

### Accurate Data

Accurate data is essential for providing transit riders with a reliable and user-friendly transportation experience. Errors in the data can block a portion or the totality of a dataset from being used. 

### Up to Date

Having out of date data is almost worse than no feed at all. It's not enough to simply publish information‚Äîit has to match what the rider sees and experiences. Some of the largest transit agencies update their GTFS weekly, or even daily, but most agencies will need to update their GTFS every few months, or a few times a year when service changes. This includes things like new routes or stops, timetable changes, or updates to fare structure.
 
Many agencies hire a vendor to create and manage their GTFS for them. Some vendors may be proactive in asking about service changes, but it‚Äôs important that agencies communicate with vendors about upcoming service changes. It‚Äôs possible to publish GTFS with service changes in advance, making sure the transition goes smoothly for everyone‚Äîagencies, vendors, trip planners, and riders!

## Making your GTFS Publicly Available

GTFS data can be utilized in many ways, and publicly sharing your agency‚Äôs GTFS data provides many benefits to your riders and your agency as a whole. These include: 

* Integrating your feed into mobile and web-based trip planning applications, allowing riders to plan trips on your system 
* Submitting your feed to a GTFS aggregator such as Transitland, which provides a wider audience and more visibility for your agency 
* Using tools that allow GTFS data to be visualized and analyzed in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and other map-based analysis programs  

### Benefits to Sharing your GTFS

#### Trip Planning Apps

When your agency‚Äôs GTFS data is publicly shared, it can be utilized by a variety of trip planning applications in addition to Google Maps. These can include other navigation apps such as Bing Maps + Apple Maps, as well as transit-specific platforms like Transit, Moovit, Transportr, and Citymapper. Additionally, access to open feed data enables developers to make apps that are geared toward particular regions or can have features that aren‚Äôt included in the standard trip planners. Some examples include: 

* [Vamos](https://vamosmobileapp.com/) (*San Joaquin & Stanislaus Counties, California*) - Vamos is a mobile app that supports trip planning and fare payments for transit agencies in San Joaquin and Stanislaus Counties in California, including Altamont Commuter Express, San Joaquin RTD, and Stanislaus County RTA. Within the app, users can plan multi-agency trips and also buy passes from participating agencies. Coming updates to the app include fare payment  for all agencies in the trip planner, as well as support for GTFS extensions such as Fares V2, which will allow the app to support and display more complex fare structures, particularly on inter-agency trips.
* [MetroHero](https://dcmetrohero.com/dashboard) (*Washington D.C. area*) - MetroHero is a mobile app that uses WMATA‚Äôs GTFS-static and realtime feeds to allow you to visualize your commute in multiple ways. Users can view real-time vehicle locations, as well as station-level arrival times, service alerts, and  elevator or escalator outages. The app also allows for extensive analysis of current and historical agency data, even allowing users to carry out a ‚ÄúLive Performance Audit‚Äù of WMATA headway adherence at the stop level. 
* [Entur](https://entur.no/) (*Norway*) - Entur offers multi-modal travel planning for all of Norway, including bus, train, ferry, metro, plane, and e-scooter. Users can purchase tickets through the app and filter trip options by factors such as transport type, walking speed, and transition time between legs. Entur‚Äôs goal is to make it easy to choose public transportation in Norway.

#### Feed Aggregators

Sharing your GTFS data also allows it to be indexed by GTFS feed aggregation platforms, which can include state- or region-level directories of GTFS feeds, as well as international feed aggregators like [Transitland](https://www.transit.land/) and the [Mobility Database](https://database.mobilitydata.org/). Being indexed on a feed aggregator increases your agency‚Äôs visibility and allows developers, researchers, and other interested parties to easily access your agency‚Äôs data for a variety of purposes, including the development of new applications.

#### Integration with GIS, Analysis, and other Platforms and Tools

GTFS data can also be imported into and used in a variety of geospatial analysis platforms. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) programs like Esri‚Äôs ArcGIS, as well as the open-source QGIS have their own plugins and extensions that can import and visualize GTFS stop and route data:
* Esri has a [wide variety of tools and plugins](https://esri.github.io/public-transit-tools/) that use GTFS data, including visualizing schedule data
* In QGIS, [GTFS-GO](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/GTFS-GO-master/) and [GTFS Loader](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/GTFS_Loader/) allow you to visualize routes + stops within the platform  
* [Additional analysis tools](https://gtfs.org/resources/gtfs/#gtfs-analysis-tools)

Other platforms allow you to visualize and analyze GTFS data in unique ways:
* [Conveyal](https://conveyal.com/) is an open-source program that allows users to import GTFS data to visualize schedules, routes, and patterns, and analyze impacts of potential service changes. Users can also import and work with demographic data to carry out analyses on, for example, how different routes or schedules would affect access to jobs in a particular urban area.
* [GTFS to HTML](https://gtfstohtml.com/) is an open-source tool that enables the conversion of GTFS schedule data into HTML timetables. It allows agencies to automatically publish and update their schedules to their website in a format that can also be read by screen readers, making the data accessible to visually impaired people.

### Sharing your Data: Tips & Best Practices

#### Create and Maintain a Permanent Fetch Link

A fetch link is a permanent URL at which your agency‚Äôs static GTFS files are stored. Typically, it is hosted either on your agency‚Äôs website or by your vendor, if you contract with one for GTFS production. This is the way that trip planning apps like Google Maps access your data. Ideally, your static GTFS files should be downloadable directly from this URL without requiring a login. However, if this is not feasible due to licensing restrictions, your agency can control access to the data by using and issuing API keys to users of the data. If your agency does not currently host its static GTFS files on its website, contact your webmaster or IT specialist - they should be able to set up a simple hosting URL for you.

#### URL and File Names

Consistent fetch link and GTFS file names are crucial to ensuring access to your feed data. If your agency does not use consistent URLs and file names for its data, it means that trip planning apps, feed aggregators, and other users will not get the most accurate and up-to-date data, which will cause problems in the long run.   
   
Once you have set a URL for your permanent fetch link, **DO NOT CHANGE IT**. This means that the URL name should stay consistent, even if the files themselves are updated. As such, keep your URLs as simple and generic as possible, and avoid using URLs that have dates or version numbers in them.   
**GOOD:** http://www.bart.gov/dev/schedules/google_transit.zip,  
**AVOID**: http://www.bart.gov/dev/schedules/google_transit_Fall_2021.zip

Likewise, keep the name of the ZIP folder containing the GTFS static files consistent, even if you make any updates to the feed itself. For example, when you update a feed, you should not add any sort of date or version number to the ZIP folder name. If you would like to include data on the feed version or feed start and end dates in the feed, you can include it in the feed_info.txt file.  
**GOOD:** ‚ÄúYourAgency_gtfs.zip‚Äù, ‚Äúgoogle_transit.zip‚Äù, ‚Äúgtfs.zip‚Äù   
**AVOID:** ‚ÄúYourAgency_gtfs_092921.zip‚Äù, ‚ÄúYourAgency_Fall2021.zip‚Äù

#### File Configuration and Integrity

Your GTFS is a zip file containing several interconnected text files (.txt). In order to ensure the format is correct, always do the following:

1. When opening a text file, make sure you keep the values as text. There are a lot of fields in a GTFS that applications like Excel will read incorrectly, or abbreviate. 
2. The files are comma delimited, not tab delimited. This means each file contains records in rows, and the different fields are separated by commas.
3. Extra rows or columns will cause errors on consuming applications, so make sure there are no empty rows or columns when saving the file.
4. Do not discard any of the files in your GTFS - they work together and any missing files may cause errors with consuming applications.
5. When re-zipping the files, make sure to zip up the files, not a containing folder. You can be sure you have done this correctly by unzipping your file and immediately seeing the files in that folder, not another folder containing the files.

#### Additional Considerations

GTFS is an open data specification, and the best practice is to ensure that when you organize your agency‚Äôs information into GTFS format,  it is made available for anyone wishing to use it. This means that it is also possible your agency‚Äôs data could be included in a different feed than the one you are maintaining.

The best way to ensure that your GTFS is the one that gets used by an application is to make that data publicly available. This ensures that if a conflict arises about the source of a feed, you can definitively point to your GTFS as the best one to use.

There are cases where an application, such as Google Maps, must select data from one GTFS source over another. One common example is a stop‚Äôs name and code‚Äîmany agencies may share a single stop, each with their own name and code. Because only one name and code is shown on this application, the best way to ensure it matches what you wish riders to see is to coordinate your GTFS with other overlapping agencies. If all affected agencies agree upon the name and code, then the likelihood of conflicts between multiple GTFS datasets is minimized.

In the event you have multiple GTFS datasets available to you‚Äîusually the result of one being produced for public applications like Transit App, and another being produced for internal operational CAD/AVL systems‚Äî you may need to decide which one will be the published GTFS. It is recommended you choose to promote the feed  that contains the most rider-facing information. GTFS that contains internal/jargony names for routes or stops, lacks fare information, or contains stop locations placed to intersect with the path of travel of the bus (common for CAD/AVL systems) should not be considered for public use. Whenever possible, seek to have your GTFS datasets match (same ids for things like stops and trips) so that internal ones do not conflict with public ones, and integrating other feeds like GTFS-RT is possible.
