- [MIT COAXS](http://mittransportanalyst.github.io/) - Co-creative Planning of Transit Corridors using Accessibility-Based Stakeholder Engagement (shows route scenarios using [OpenTripPlanner Analyst](http://www.opentripplanner.org/analyst/)).
- [TRAVIC Transit Visualization Client](http://tracker.geops.ch/) - Visualizes vehicles moving based on static GTFS data (and sometimes realtime data). Supports over 260 cities.  Github account for geOps organization is [here](https://github.com/geops).
- [MTA Frequency](http://www.tyleragreen.com/maps/new_york/) - Frequency visualization of subways and buses in New York City built using [Transitland](https://transit.land/).
- [Traze](https://traze.app/) by [Veridict](https://www.veridict.com) - Visualization of public transport vehicles from all over the world. Collaborate with other users to get real-time updates even when it is not available from the agency. Based on a number of sources, including GTFS and GTFS-RT. (Previously known as [Livemap24](https://www.livemap24.com)). 
- [SEPTA Rail OTP Report](https://apps.phor.net/septa/) - An online on-time performance reporing & drill down tool using GTFS.
- [TransitFlow](https://github.com/transitland/transitland-processing-animation) Animate GTFS data around the world using Processing and Transitland.
- [All Transit](https://all-transit.com) - Interactive GTFS route and schedule animation (for U.S. cities) using Mapbox GL JS, Deck.gl and Transitland. Github repository [here](https://github.com/kylebarron/all-transit).
- [gtfspy-webviz](https://github.com/CxAalto/gtfspy-webviz) - Web application for animation and visualization of GTFS data using [gtfspy](https://github.com/CxAalto/gtfspy).
- [Mapnificent](https://www.mapnificent.net/) - Shows areas you can reach with public transport in a given time. Open-source [on GitHub](https://github.com/mapnificent/mapnificent), live at https://www.mapnificent.net/.
- [Toronto Transit Explorer](https://github.com/sidewalklabs/totx) - A Java application that visualizes transit, biking and walking accessibility across the city of Toronto.

- [fastest-bus-analysis-in-the-west](https://github.com/vta/fastest-bus-analysis-in-the-west) - A python Pandas script that combines Ridership/APC, Swiftly speed and dwell data, bus stop inventory, GTFS, and geospatial shapes to create a stop by stop, route by route, time grouping filterable dataset for cross-analyses.  The dataset is then visualized in [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/vivek7797#!/vizhome/stopsandspeedanalyses/Story1) to help VTA Planners find places to make bus and rail network faster and more reliable through speedups methods like stop consolidation and dedicated lanes.
- [TNExT](https://github.com/ODOT-PTS/TNExT) - Transit Network Explorer Tool (TNExT) is a web-based software tool developed for the visualization, analysis, and reporting of regional and statewide transit networks in the state of Oregon.
