# Visualizations

- [All Transit](https://all-transit.com) - Interactive GTFS route and schedule animation (for U.S. cities) using Mapbox GL JS, Deck.gl and Transitland. Github repository [here](https://github.com/kylebarron/all-transit).
- [fastest-bus-analysis-in-the-west](https://github.com/vta/fastest-bus-analysis-in-the-west) - A python Pandas script that combines Ridership/APC, Swiftly speed and dwell data, bus stop inventory, GTFS, and geospatial shapes to create a stop by stop, route by route, time grouping filterable dataset for cross-analyses.  The dataset is then visualized in [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/vivek7797#!/vizhome/stopsandspeedanalyses/Story1) to help VTA Planners find places to make bus and rail network faster and more reliable through speedups methods like stop consolidation and dedicated lanes.
