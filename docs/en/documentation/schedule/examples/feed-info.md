# Feed information

## Provide information about the GTFS dataset

On top of providing information about agencies and their services, it is possible to provide information about the GTFS dataset using the file [feed_info.txt](../../reference/#feed_infotxt). This includes:

- Publisher details
- Feed language
- Feed validity 
- Version

Below is an example from Transport for Cairio:

[**feed_info.txt**](../../reference/#feed_infotxt)

```
feed_publisher_name,feed_publisher_url,feed_lang,feed_start_date,feed_end_date,feed_version
Transport for Cairo,http://transportforcairo.com/,en,20160101,20161201,0.5
```
