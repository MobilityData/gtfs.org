### Community list of data standards, APIs, apps, tools, datasets, and research around open source technology of public transit.

Open technology provides an opportunity for various stakeholders to collaborate efforts to improve public transit.

Elements of open technology include:
- Open standards
- Open data
- Open source software (both as consumer-facing apps like OpenTripPlanner and developer tools like the GTFS Validator)

This list is focused around the open technology ecosystem for public transportation. Included technologies may be open source themselves and/or rely on open standards and/or open data.
