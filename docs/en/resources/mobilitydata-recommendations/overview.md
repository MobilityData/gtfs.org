# MobilityData Recommendations

MobilityData is the non-profit organization responsible for the maintenance of GTFS. We work directly with data producers, consuming applications, and open data enthusiasts in the transit community to produce a series of recommendations. 

These recommendations are meant to answer questions about complex use cases, provide guidance on generally accepted practices, and improve the overall quality of GTFS data produced across the world. 

If there’s a subject or topic you’d like to see written about, don’t hesitate to let us know in our Github Discussions.
