# Change Process

## Overview

The specification Change Process guides how the community proposes, reviews, and adopts changes to the specification in the [GTFS Repository](https://github.com/google/transit/pulls). 

The specification Change Process is divided into **2 main stages** and categorized into **3 tracks** according to the three [change types](../change-types): [functional changes](../change-types/#1-functional-changes), [non-functional changes](../change-types/#2-non-functional-changes), and [documentation maintenance](../change-types/#3-documentation-maintenance). 

<img class="center" width="1200" height="100%" src="../../../../assets/governance-process-overview.svg" alt="GTFS Governance Change Process overview"> 

### Stage 1: Issue 

The Issue Stage is meant for discussing new ideas, identifying needs, and proposing improvements to the specification. Issues help evaluate the necessity and support for a change, while organizing the resources required to proceed to the Pull Request Stage. 

It’s recommended to start at the Issue stage to build consensus around new ideas. However, if the proposal’s scope is already well-defined, beginning directly at the Pull Request Stage is appropriate.

### Stage 2: Pull Request 

The Pull Request Stage is where ideas from the Issue Stage are developed and implemented into the specification. This stage is divided into 3 tracks depending on the change type. 

The entire process happens within the [GitHub google/transit repository](https://github.com/google/transit/pulls) and ensures that all changes are thoroughly evaluated before being adopted.

## Process Tracks

Depending on the type of the proposed change, different tracks apply to the Change Process. While the Issue Stage remains the same across all three tracks, the Pull Request Stage varies for each track.

### Track A: Functional Changes

<img class="center" width="1200" height="100%" src="../../../../assets/governance-process-functional.svg" alt="GTFS Governance Change Process Track A"> 

This process guides how the community proposes, reviews, and adopts [Functional changes](../change-types/#1-functional-changes) to the specification in the [GTFS Repository](https://github.com/google/transit/pulls). 

* A proposal is submitted by opening a Pull Request in the GTFS Repository.   
* The community engages in discussions to refine the proposal and reviews it before testing.   
* After a preliminary vote, [First Adopters](../roles/#first-adopter) test the proposed changes.   
* The community votes to decide whether the changes should be officially adopted.  
* Finally, changes are implemented into the specification.

### Track B: Non-Functional Changes

<img class="center" width="1200" height="100%" src="../../../../assets/governance-process-non-functional.svg" alt="GTFS Governance Change Process Track B"> 

This process guides how the community proposes, reviews, and adopts [Non-Functional changes](../change-types/#2-non-functional-changes) to the specification in the [GTFS Repository](https://github.com/google/transit/pulls).

* A proposal is submitted by opening a Pull Request in the GTFS Repository.   
* The community engages in discussions to refine the proposal.  
* The community votes to decide whether the changes should be officially adopted.  
* Finally, changes are implemented into the specification.

### Track C: Documentation Maintenance

<img class="center" width="1200" height="100%" src="../../../../assets/governance-process-documentation.svg" alt="GTFS Governance Change Process Track C"> 

This process guides how the community proposes, reviews, and adopts [changes to maintain the documentation](../change-types/#3-documentation-maintenance) in the [GTFS Repository](https://github.com/google/transit/pulls).

* A proposal is submitted by opening a Pull Request in the GTFS Repository.   
* The community engages in discussions to refine the proposal  
* Finally, changes are implemented into the specification.

## Process Steps

All of the steps in the Issue and Pull Request Stages are highlighted below. Consider that only Track A utilizes all the steps. Track B and Track C utilize a shortened version of the process:
