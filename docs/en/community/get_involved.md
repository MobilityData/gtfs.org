## GTFS Governance

The GTFS Specification is not set in stone. Instead, it is an open specification developed and maintained by the community of transit agencies, developers, and other stakeholders who use GTFS. It is expected that this community of producers and consumers of GTFS data will have proposals for extending the spec to enable new capabilities.

To formalize this process, we've established the GTFS Governance framework, which includes the Specification Amendment Process.

## Extensions

Extensions are proposals to change the specification that are composed by a collection of related files and fields. Additional files and fields can be extended onto GTFS datasets to accommodate a variety of application-specific needs communicated between transit agencies and software vendors, even if these fields are not in the official specification. Once adopted, extensions are merged and documented into the official specification as a set of features.

## Active projects

The community is constantly developing new additions to the specification that could require discussions and working group meetings to accomplish their larger goals in an open source setting. Working group meetings are consensus building discussions led by a facilitator, and attended by developpers, and interested contributors.

### Mailing Lists

There are a number of mailing lists that can be good resources when you have questions about public transit data, software, formats like GTFS and GTFS-realtime, and other issues:

* [GTFS Changes](https://groups.google.com/group/gtfs-changes): Follow this group to get announcement on votes on the GTFS Schedule Format as outlined in the [GTFS Schedule Specification Amendment Process](../../community/governance/gtfs_schedule_amendment_process). 
* [GTFS Realtime](https://groups.google.com/group/gtfs-realtime): This group is the official forum for discussing GTFS Realtime, asking questions, and proposing changes as outlined in the [GTFS Realtime Specification Amendment Process](../../community/governance/gtfs_realtime_amendment_process).
* [transit-developers](https://groups.google.com/group/transit-developers): general transit developer discussions.
  * Many transit agencies also have their own developer mailing lists specific to the agency. For example:
    * [NYC MTA](https://groups.google.com/group/mtadeveloperresources)
    * [Portland, OR](https://groups.google.com/group/transit-developers-pdx)
    * [MBTA](https://groups.google.com/group/massdotdevelopers)
    * [Atlanta, GA region](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/atl-transit-developers)
    * [511 San Francisco Bay Area Developer Resources](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/511sfbaydeveloperresources)
- [OpenTripPlanner](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner) Community
    - [OpenTripPlanner User mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opentripplanner-users)
Check with your local transit agency to see if they have a mailing list of their own.
