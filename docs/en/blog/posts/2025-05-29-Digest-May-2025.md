## üó≥Ô∏è Currently Voting

[**Add cars_allowed field to trips.txt #547**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/547)

This PR proposes adding a cars_allowed field to trips.txt. There was a lot of discussion in [issue #466](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/466) about how to add car information for ferries to GTFS. The discussion was centered around whether to use an approach with stop_times.txt or trips.txt.   

## üöÄ Recently Adopted

[**More clarifications on trip modifications #542**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/542)  
This PR clarifies misconception on trip modifications, including:

* Specify that the shape provided should be the full shape  
* Clarification on usage of ids inside a GTFS-rt   
* Clarification that linked entities should be done inside the same feed  
* The definition of shape_id that's inside TripProperties was not in sync between reference and the proto

## üìÇ Active Proposals

[**[GTFS Fares v2] Semantics clarification #561**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/561)  
Based on recent discussions in the gtfs-fares Slack channel and working group, clarify some fares v2 related semantics including: Introduction of  a Local Time data type, addition of an "effective fare leg"and a "timer should start from the first matched leg" clarification.

[**[GTFS-Fares v2] Add Distance-Based Fares #556**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/556)  
This PR adds a new functionality to allow the modelling of Distance-based fare systems, by introducing multiple new fields on fare_leg_rules.txt and stop_times.txt as well as a new fare_leg_distance_rules.txt file.

[**Add communication_period and impact_period #546**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/546)  
This proposal introduces two new fields: communication_period specifying the time that alerts should be displayed and impact_period to specify the time when the services are affected by the disruption. Additionally, it establishes rules to ensure these new fields are mutually exclusive with active_period for consistency.

[**Add cemv_support field in agency.txt and routes.txt #545**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/545)  
This proposal introduces a new cemv_support field in agency.txt and routes.txt to indicate if riders can use cEMV (contactless Europay, Mastercard, and Visa) to access a transit service under a specific agency or route.

## üî• Most Active Conversations

[**Make agency_url optional #563**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/563)
