**Juliet Eldred**

Thank you for pointing out an inconsistency in the GTFS documentation in your [first issue](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/435)! It‚Äôs contributions like yours that help us make the spec more accessible.

## üó≥Ô∏è Currently Voting

**[GTFS Trip-Modifications #403](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/403)**

Trip-Modifications are modifications done to a trip to modify its shape, remove stops that are not served, and potentially add temporary stops. [Trip-Modifications is mainly used for visualizing detours and updating realtime predictions.](https://blog.transitapp.com/how-transit-and-swiftly-put-bus-detours-on-the-map/)



* Voting for an experimental field ends on 2024-03-06 at 23:59:59 UTC. 


## üìÇ Active Proposals

**[GTFS-Flex [voting ver.] #433 ](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/433)**

The GTFS-Flex proposal allows passengers to discover demand-responsive services on trip planners; it has undergone multiple discussions and is currently being reviewed by contributors. 



* This PR is the **"voting version" of PR#388**, with changes that align completely with the changes up to PR#388. The only difference is that this PR is based on the current spec, while PR#388 is based on the spec from July last year.
* Support resources from first adopters for voting will be released soon.

**[Add Feed Version and GTFS url to the GTFS real time FeedHeader #434](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/434)**

This Realtime proposal adds two new fields to the feed header to provide information on the GTFS schedule file to be used with the GTFS real time data: feed_version would match the feed_version in the feed_info.txt file of the GTFS, while GTFS_url would point to the url of the GTFS file. A producer willing to implement this change is required to move forward.

**[Clarify stops.zone_id conditional requirement for route-based fare_rules #432](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/432)** \
This proposal modifies the conditional requirement for stops.zone_id to allow for the scenario in which the stop is only assigned to trip_ids whose route_id is present in a fare_rules.txt record with only fare_id and route_id defined (route-based fares).

**[Integration of carpooling lines #430](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/430)**

Aur√©lien from the French National Access Point (NAP) has opened a GitHub Issue to discuss a potential proposal to model Carpooling lines behaving like bus lines: with precise stops and destinations, but in this case, driven by regular car drivers that can receive a money incentive from fares, or share their costs with passengers. Two different potential solutions are presented for discussion.

**[Slack conversation in #gtfs-realtime](https://mobilitydata-io.slack.com/archives/C3D321CKB/p1706193156057089)**
