## üèÖ Contributor Shoutouts

**gcamp**

**barbagus**

* Shoutout for redacting your first [issue #409](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/409) with great clarity and high detail. Very elegantly put!

**abyrd**

* Hats off for delivering meticulous reviews on active Pull Requests, [this is pure gold](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/403#issuecomment-1841006022)!

**ponlawat-w**

* Shoutout for contributing in your first PR [#412](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/412) by bringing editorial corrections to the attention of the community.

## üöÄ Recently Adopted

**[Best practices: adding Dataset Publishing guidelines and Practice Recommendations for all files #406](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/406)**

This proposal focuses on adding the [Dataset Publishing & General Practice guidelines](https://gtfs.org/schedule/best-practices/#dataset-publishing-general-practices), and [Practice Recommendations for all files](https://gtfs.org/schedule/best-practices/#all-files) into the GTFS specification's reference file. This represents the second phase of the merging of Best Practices into the GTFS specification as outlined in issue [#396](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/396).

**[[GTFS-Fares v2] Add networks.txt & route_networks.txt #405](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/405)**

GTFS-Schedule and GTFS-Fares v2 data are not always produced by the same organization/departments, and they are not always updated at the same frequency. This proposal allows the production of Fares and Schedule Data separately.

## üó≥Ô∏è Currently Voting

**[Remove Best Practices content merged into spec (Phase 2) #60](https://github.com/MobilityData/GTFS_Schedule_Best-Practices/pull/60)**

After [PR #406](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/406) merged specific best practices directly into the GTFS specification, this proposal removes the duplicated content from the Best Practices document, consolidating a single source of truth. **Vote closes on 2023-12-26.**

## üìÇ Active Proposals

**[GTFS-Flex #388](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/388)**

The GTFS-Flex proposal allows passengers to discover demand-responsive services on trip planners; it has undergone multiple discussions and is currently being reviewed by contributors.

* Most recent GTFS-Flex Working Group Meeting held on November 1, 2023:
    * Agreed on dedicated foreign keys in stop_times.txt for issue (google/transit#398).
    * Reverted to using location_groups.txt and removed its references to location.geojson ids (google/transit#397).
    * Maintained pickup_type=3 restriction for hail-and-ride/taxi-like use cases (google/transit#400).
* [Check out the last outstanding issues here](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/388#issuecomment-1805958429) and [here](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/388#pullrequestreview-1766734999).

**[GTFS Trip-Modifications #403](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/403)**

Trip-Modifications are modifications done to a trip to modify its shape, remove stops that are not served, and potentially add temporary stops. [Trip-Modifications is mainly used for visualizing detours and updating realtime predictions.](https://blog.transitapp.com/how-transit-and-swiftly-put-bus-detours-on-the-map/)

**[[GTFS-Fares v2] Add rule_priority to fare_leg_rules.txt #418](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/418)**

The rule_priority field defines the order of priority in which matching rules are applied to legs, allowing certain rules to take precedence over others. Its presence acts as a trigger, shifting the empty semantics from "anything except" to ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt affect matching.‚Äù

## üî• Most Active Conversations

**[Modifications to the GTFS Governance: Phasing Plan #413](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/413)**

MobilityData suggests refinements to improve both the formal amendment process and informal aspects of GTFS governance. Included in the issue are common community-identified problems and a proposed phased plan.

**[Required type of transportation at routes level may lack flexibility (multi-modal routes) #409](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/409)**

Some routes are designed to be operated with both trains and buses depending on the trip. In the current GTFS specification, the "type of transportation" is a routes attribute and as such, cannot elegantly handle such use cases.

**[Slack conversation in #mobilitydata](https://mobilitydata-io.slack.com/archives/C0J4TJY8L/p1702318548285739)**

Melinda would love to get your insights on Best Practices for feed consumers and app developers. She asks: ‚Äúall the best practices so far are intended for GTFS creators, right? Has anyone thought about a separate set of best practices for developers working with GTFS datasets?‚Äù

**[Slack conversation in #gtfs](https://mobilitydata-io.slack.com/archives/C3FFFKX9C/p1701735882006169)**

Steve could use your help to answer these questions: ‚ÄúDoes anyone know of a tool/service that lets you visualize a GTFS file on a map without having to convert to other formats?‚Äù
