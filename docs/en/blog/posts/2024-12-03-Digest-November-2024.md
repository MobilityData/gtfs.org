## üìÇ Active Proposals

[**[GTFS Fares v2] Add rider_categories.txt #511**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/511)  
The rider_categories.txt file is part of the GTFS-Fares v2 proposal, aimed at modeling rider categories that are eligible for certain fares.

[**Add stops.stop_access field #515**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/515)

## üî• Most Active Conversations

[Add communication_period and impact_period to GTFS Service Alerts #521](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/521)  
The GTFS Realtime Alert active_period field is ambiguous, as it could mean either the alert's display period or the disruption's duration. A proposal suggests adding communication_period for the alert's display and impact_period for the disruption timeframe to clarify its use.

[Frequencies.txt primary key: add end_time, headway_secs & exact_times? #514](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/514)  
This issue proposes the extension of the primary key of frequencies.txt to cover trips with overlapping time windows and different headway_secs (such as additional bus services during rush hour) or different exact_times.

[Specifying wheelchair_boarding for a platform which isn't accessible from outside, but accessible for interchange purpose #516](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/516)  
This issue proposes a wheelchair_accessible field in pathways.txt to be able to explicitly state if a pathway is accessible and thus identify wheelchair accessible routes within stations.

[Drop the requirement of no locked platforms in pathways.txt #517](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/517)  
This issue proposes to make requirements for pathways more flexible by removing the requirement of every platform to be connected to at least one entrance/exit via a chain of pathways.

[Best Practices: Reasonable lengths in unique ids #518](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/518)  
This issue proposes to introduce a best practice that sets a recommended character limit for any ID used in a GTFS feed, triggering a validator warning if a value exceeds 36 bytes.

[Add license information in the GTFS feed #519](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/519)  
License information can make the process of ingesting a GTFS feed quicker by providing a direct access to the legal obligations and restrictions by the producer of the GTFS.

[Specify features such as tunnel in shapes.txt #520](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/520)  
This issue proposes a new field in shapes.txt to specify en-route features, such as tunnels. Answers from different contributors have pointed out multiple options to represent this in GTFS.

[Add demand based frequency to the exact_times field of frequencies.txt #522](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/522)  
This issue uses examples like Cairo micro-buses to propose the addition of a new option for exact_times to designate trips that will depart based on factors including passenger demand

[Define "header.incrementality: DIFFERENTIAL" consumer/producer behavior #84](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/84)  
This revived issue focuses on clarifying the roles of CANCELED/SKIPPED in TripUpdates and NO_SERVICE in Alerts. Latest discussions focused on ensuring CANCELED impacts routing while NO_SERVICE informs riders of disruptions..
