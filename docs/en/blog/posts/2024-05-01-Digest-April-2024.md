# [GTFS Digest] April 2024 - Validating GTFS-Flex and lots of discussions
Exciting news! Spare Labs is beta testing a Free GTFS-Flex Builder, and MobilityData is progressing with the Flex rules proposal for the Canonical GTFS Schedule Validator. Topics of interest include UTF-8 encoding, refinement of GTFS Terminology, improving station modeling, enhancing voting processes, and clarifying constraints on pathways.stair_count.

The GTFS Digest is a resource generated monthly by [MobilityData](https://mobilitydata.org/) providing an overview of developments on GTFS. 

We really value your feedback and would like to know how we did. We invite you to fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/GGefktvemnJD5Q9g8) and help us achieve the full potential of this tool. 


## üèÖ Contributor Shoutouts

**Skinkie**

Thank you Stefan for bringing up your [issue on UTF-8](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/444) in GTFS garnering some good support from the community. Can't wait to see how it develops. 

**Michael Schnuerle**

Your [question on visualization of public GTFS feeds](https://mobilitydata-io.slack.com/archives/C3FFFKX9C/p1713549098280889) has garnered a lot of attention and has brought value to the community. Thank you!

**Walter Jenkins**

We would like to take the time to acknowledge Walter‚Äôs multiple replies to your Slack messages. He has been a great contributor over the past few months! 

**Leo Frachet **

Shoutout to Leo for sharing the development of a[ free GTFS-Flex Builder](https://mobilitydata-io.slack.com/archives/CSP7HDF37/p1714403189427409) by Spare Labs with the community. 


## üì¢ Announcements

**Implemented quality of life changes to MobilityData‚Äôs Slack **



* [New onboarding process to guide newcomers ](https://mobilitydata-io.slack.com/archives/C0J4TJY8L/p1712685177998819)
* [Automatic notifications have been moved from #gtfs to an opt-in channel #gtfs-notifications](https://mobilitydata-io.slack.com/archives/C0J4TJY8L/p1712584074316179)


## üó≥Ô∏è Currently Voting

**[Clarify stops.zone_id conditional requirement for route-based fare_rules #432](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/432)** \
This proposal modifies the conditional requirement for stops.zone_id to allow for the scenario in which the stop is only assigned to trip_ids whose route_id is present in a fare_rules.txt record with only fare_id and route_id defined (route-based fares).



* Voting ends on 2024-04-30 at 23:59:59 UTC. 


## üìÇ Active Proposals

**[Add Best Practices source documentation in the google/transit repo #447](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/447)**

This PR adds the Best Practice documentation into this repo to consolidate the reference documentation in this repo, and give the Best Practices more visibility. The GTFS Realtime Best Practices have also been consolidated into one single document so it's easier to read. 

**[[GTFS-Fares v2] Add fare_leg_join_rules.txt (first iteration) #439](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/439)**

In real fare structures, a common scenario is that the fare is only a function of the start and endpoint (or zones traveled through) and doesn‚Äôt care what series of legs or transfers are taken in-between. The rules for joining multiple legs into an ‚Äúeffective leg‚Äù can be defined in fare_leg_join_rules.txt.

This PR currently only allows joining legs within the same network. The working group may expand this file with additional functionalities in the future (such as joining legs from different networks, stop pairs, etc.).

**[Add Feed Version and GTFS url to the GTFS real time FeedHeader #434](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/434)**

This Realtime proposal adds two new fields to the feed header to provide information on the GTFS schedule file to be used with the GTFS real time data: feed_version would match the feed_version in the feed_info.txt file of the GTFS, while GTFS_url would point to the url of the GTFS file. A producer willing to implement this change is required to move forward.


### Other open proposals

[[GTFS-Fares v2] Add rule_priority to fare_leg_rules.txt #418](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/418)

[[GTFS-Fares v2] Fare product/media transfer behavior #423](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/423)<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span>



## üî• Most Active Conversations

**[Make UTF-8 the mandatory GTFS encoding #444](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/444)**

Stefan raised a concern regarding producers using various encodings, and even mixing them, which leads to data processing issues for consumers. To address this, he proposed clearly mandating the use of UTF-8.

**[Refinement of GTFS Terminology: Transitioning from "Schedule" to "Static" #442](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/442) **

MobilityData proposes to harmonize the language around GTFS Schedule as many use the terms ‚ÄúSchedule‚Äù and ‚ÄúStatic‚Äù interchangeably. 



* There is some consensus around the use of ‚ÄúStatic‚Äù as the official terminology. 
* Some would consider dropping both ‚ÄúStatic‚Äù and ‚ÄúSchedule‚Äù.

Join the debate and let us know your thoughts. 

**[Improving station modeling in GTFS #438](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/438)**

Recently, MobilityData has received feedback pointing out limitations and difficulties regarding station modeling. Examples include the lack of clear mechanism for whether a stop needs to go through an entrance, and confusion in search and visualization. In discussions, the community has also mentioned the possibility of adding a higher level of hierarchy. However, we've also found that community members have different interpretations of the current location_type=1(station). Please share your thoughts on station modeling in this issue!

**[[Governance] Phase 2: Enhancing Voting and Reviews #436](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/436)**

This GitHub Issue is part of the ongoing effort to enhance the GTFS Governance, particularly focusing on the Specification Amendment Process outlined in phase 2 of the [phasing plan](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/413) published in December 2023.



* An interactive discussion was held on 13 March, 2024. Participants shared their feedback and some high level consensus was achieved.
* A Working Group has been formed and a meeting will be held on [Thursday May 2, 2024 @ 11am EDT ](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/gtfs-governance-working-group-meeting-may-2nd-11-am-edt-tickets-890410801677?aff=oddtdtcreator)

**[Clarifying constraints on pathways.stair_count #437](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/437)**

Michael Kearney has flagged a potential problem with the definition of pathways.stair_count and raises some questions around the meaning of empty and 0 values, then proposes four potential solutions for discussions, but points out some potential backwards compatibility problems. This issue requires further discussion from the community.
