# [GTFS Digest] July 2025 - Celebrating Governance, New Contributors, and New Conversations!

Welcome to another edition of the GTFS Digest. This month, we saw the adoption of the new Governance framework after two years of community-driven feedback. If you‚Äôre curious about what‚Äôs changed, check out [our documentation.](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs/Governance/introduction.md) Although there aren‚Äôt any proposals actively being voted on, that doesn‚Äôt mean Github isn‚Äôt active! There are quite a few conversations happening at the moment, so read on to find out more. 

<!-- more -->

The GTFS Digest is a resource distributed monthly by [MobilityData](https://mobilitydata.org/) providing an overview of developments on GTFS.

We really value your feedback and would like to know what you think of the new layout. We invite you to fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/GGefktvemnJD5Q9g8) and help us achieve the full potential of this tool.

## üêô Most Active Conversations on Github

*Github Issues is a great place to start a conversation, whether it‚Äôs about a new feature idea or a question about a spec. Below are this month‚Äôs most active conversations.*

| Conversation | Author | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| [Add activities field to informed_entity in GTFS-realtime alerts #573](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/573)  | natekauf | This issue proposes the addition of a new activities field within informed_entity in the GTFS Realtime Alert spec. This field would have enumerated values of BOARD, EXIT, and RIDE, which describe the rider activities that are unavailable at a given stop.   |
| [Required type of transportation at routes level may lack flexibility (multi-modal routes) #409](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/409) | barbagus | This issue shares concerns around the potential inflexibility of route_type with multimodal routes, and suggests potential ways of addressing it. |
| [Use of block_id together with required arrival_time and departure_time makes contradictory information too easy #569](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/569)  | bradyhunsaker | This issue describes a problem displaying  service information in trip planning apps, caused by mismatched times between block_id-linked trips in GTFS feeds, leading to duplicate or conflicting departures. He suggests two fixes: align the times between linked trips or allow omitting non-meaningful times at terminal stops. |
| [Defining a route type at the trip level #358](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/358) | vpaturet | This discussion explores the possibility of adopting a new "trip_route_type" field for cases where trips in a certain route are scheduled with an alternate transport mode. This issue has captured some new comments after PR #572 was opened. |
