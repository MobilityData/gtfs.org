# [GTFS Digest] December 2024 - 2 Votes and 1 Adoption to celebrate the Digest‚Äôs 1-year anniversary!

Let's celebrate the Digest's 1-year anniversary with 2 votes and an adoption to the specification. The community is currently voting on a proposal to clarify the use of agency_fare_url and a proposal that specifies the behavior of ADDED, and un-deprecate REPLACEMENT in TripUpdates. We also recommend that you take a look at the latest adoption that adds fare_leg_join_rules.txt to the specification.

## üó≥Ô∏è Currently Voting

[**Clarify use of agency_fare_url #524**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/524)  
This PR extends the definition of agency_fare_url to also include URL pages with fare information instead of just pages that allow purchasing tickets.

* *The voting period ends on January 20th at 23:59:59 UTC.*

[**Specify the behaviour of TripUpdate.schedule_relationship = ADDED, and un-deprecate REPLACEMENT #504**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/504)  
This PR specifies the behavior of ADDED, and un-deprecate REPLACEMENT, based on the implementation of OpenTripPlanner which specifies the whole journey to be added or replaced. Additional fields, such as headsigns, and pickup / drop-off types, are introduced as required to support the full specification of completely new trips.

* *The voting period ends on January 15 at 23:59:59 UTC.*

[**Add fare_leg_join_rules.txt #439**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/439)  
This Pull Request introduces the concept of *Effective Fare Leg* in the term definitions, adds fare_leg_join_rules.txt to define effective fare leg, and updates the network_id, from_area_id, to_area_id, from_timeframe_group_id, and to_timeframe_group_id fields in fare_leg_rules.txt to align with this new approach.

[**[GTFS Fares v2] Add rider_categories.txt #511**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/511)

## üî• Most Active Conversations

[**Add communication_period and impact_period to GTFS Service Alerts #521**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/521)  
The GTFS Realtime Alert active_period field is ambiguous, as it could mean either the alert's display period or the disruption's duration. A proposal suggests adding communication_period for the alert's display and impact_period for the disruption timeframe to clarify its use.

[**Add a provision for event-based trips (to support modeling of trips departing "x minutes following an event") #526**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/526)
This issue proposes a GTFS method to model event-based routes whose return trips depend on the end time of the events. It suggests the addition of an event_based_trips.txt file to indicate to consumers and customers that applicable trips are post-event extras, operating based on an expected event end time.

[**Best Practices: Reasonable lengths in unique ids #518**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/518)  
This issue proposes to introduce a best practice that sets a recommended character limit for any ID used in a GTFS feed, triggering a validator warning if a value exceeds 36 bytes.
