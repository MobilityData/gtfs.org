## üêô Most Active Conversations on Github

*Github Issues is a great place to start a conversation, whether it‚Äôs about a new feature idea or a question about a spec. Below are this month‚Äôs most active conversations.*

| Conversation | Author | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Use of block_id together with required arrival_time and departure_time makes contradictory information too easy [#569](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/569)  | bradyhunsaker  | This issue describes a problem displaying  service information in trip planning apps, caused by mismatched times between block_id-linked trips in GTFS feeds, leading to duplicate or conflicting departures. He suggests two fixes: align the times between linked trips or allow omitting non-meaningful times at terminal stops. |
| Add field for distance units [#568](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/568) | nkemphues | This issue highlights the problems caused by the lack of a defined distance unit in GTFS feeds. The proposal suggests adding an optional distance_unit field to clarify the units used in files like shapes.txt and fare_legs.txt. |
| Relax conditionally forbidden nature of prior_notice_start_day in booking_rules.txt [#566](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/566)  | m-mcqueen(TriMet) | This issue proposes to relax the conditional forbidden rule for booking_rules.prior_notice_start_day when booking_type=0 to cover the booking rules of some microtransit services. |
| Additional Accessibility Functionality for GTFS-Realtime? [#565](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/565) | nathanhale (Deloitte Digital) | Nathan asks: ‚ÄúWould there be a possibility of expanding GTFS-Realtime to additional types of accessibility beyond just wheelchairs?‚Äù |
