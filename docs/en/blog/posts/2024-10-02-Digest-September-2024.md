## üèÖ Contributor Shoutouts

**Uriel Fojas**  
Thanks for taking the time to post your first Slack thread!

**Evan Siroki, Stefan de Konink, & Weston Shippy**  
Shoutout for continuously supporting the development of GTFS by contributing 2 new issues each this past month!

**Philip Cline**  
You sparked a great conversation on GTFS merge tooling! Hope this leads to something.

## üöÄ Recently Adopted

[**Add validity rules for polygons in locations.geojson #476**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/476)  
This PR proposes to refer to the OpenGIS Simple Features Specification, section 6.1.11 to improve the validity rules for flex polygons, instead  of describing all the ways in which polygons can be invalid in GTFS.

[**[Clarification] from/to_stop_id & from/to_trip_id description in transfers.txt #455**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/455)  
This PR clarifies the description of from/to_stop_id and from/to_trip_id in transfers.txt without changing the original semantics.

## üìÇ Active Proposals

[**Adjustment to trip modifications #497**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/497)  
This PR clarifies the GTFS Realtime documentation regarding Trip Modifications, adding support for frequency based services, adding missing extensions fields in the .proto file and making documentation more comprehensive and consistent across different files.

[**[GTFS Fares v2] Add nonconsecutive_transfer_allowed field and clarify fare_transfer_type #498**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/498)  
This PR add nonconsecutive-transfer-allowed field in fare_transfer_rules.txt to indicate whether the transfer rule is allowed to apply to non-consecutive transfers, also clarifies fare_transfer_type description for journeys with multiple transfers

[**Stop Time Events in the past should be kept #502**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/502)  
This PR changes the description in StopTimeUpdates from "allowing" the retention of past stop times to "recommending" the retention.

[**Specify the behaviour of TripUpdate.schedule_relationship = ADDED, and un-deprecate REPLACEMENT #504**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/504)  
This PR specifies the behavior of ADDED, and un-deprecate REPLACEMENT, based on the implementation of OpenTripPlanner which specifies the whole journey to be added or replaced. Additional fields, such as headsigns, and pickup / drop-off types, are introduced as required to support the full specification of completely new trips.

**Other open proposals:**

* [[GTFS Fares v2] Area Set matching predicates #483](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/483)  
* [[GTFS-Fares v2] Add fare_leg_join_rules.txt (first iteration) #439](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/439)  
* [Add Feed Version and GTFS url to the GTFS real time FeedHeader #434](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/434)  
* [[GTFS-Fares v2] Fare product/media transfer behavior #423](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/423) 

## üî• Most Active Conversations

[**Adding a best practice to use HTTPS... or at least have good SSL health? #496**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/496)  
Evan suggests adding a best practice that recommends using HTTPS with good health of the SSL certificates.

[**Is the current solution for Route Deviation provided by Flex sufficient? #499**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/499)  
Weston proposes a method for modeling deviated routes directly in the stop_times.txt without creating any polygon data.

[**transfer_type = 1 #500**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/500)  
Stefan points out a potential clarification to the description of transfer_type = 1 in transfers.txt, and asks for use cases that might be missing with this approach.

[**Allow adding start and end dates to timeframes.txt #506**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/506)  
Evan suggests adding columns start_date and end_date to timeframes.txt in order to model temporary fare policies such as a free fare weekend.

[**How is continuous_pickup/continuous_drop_off forbid language interpreted? Should it be adjusted to explicitly allow values of 1? #507**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/507)  
Weston suggests clarifying the use of continuous_pickup/continuous_drop_off in stop_times.txt when modeling demand responsive services that use stop_times.end_pickup_drop_off_window, so that producers are able to specify that continuous pick-up or drop off is not allowed.

[**Missing functionality to define "conceptual grouping of stops/stations" in existing GTFS #438**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/438)  
MobilityData proposes a [3-phase plan](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/438#issuecomment-2289511429) to improve station modeling, and would love to see any feedback on the plan. If there are no major objections, we will proceed with the first phase soon.

[**Add cars_allowed field to trips.txt #466**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/466)  
Recent comments leaned towards using boarding_permissions.txt instead of adding cars_allowed to trips.txt, while also noting that the convenience of knowing whether cars are permitted to board and alight at each stop, could justify the need for special handling.
