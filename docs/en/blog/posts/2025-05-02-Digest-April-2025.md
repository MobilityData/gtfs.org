## üó≥Ô∏è Currently Voting

[**More clarifications on trip modifications #542**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/542)  
This PR clarifies misconception on trip modifications, including:

* Specify that the shape provided should be the full shape  
* Clarification on usage of ids inside a GTFS-rt   
* Clarification that linked entities should be done inside the same feed  
* The definition of shape_id that's inside TripProperties was not in sync between reference and the proto

## üöÄ Recently Adopted

[**Clarification on continuous pickup/dropoff value and field Type in booking_rules.txt #528**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/528)  
This PR introduces clarifications specifically for demand-responsive transportation (DRT) services, allowing a value of 1 for continuous_pickup/continuous_drop_off when start_pickup_drop_off_window/end_pickup_drop_off_window are indicated.

[**Deprecate TripUpdate.schedule_relationship = ADDED, add TripUpdate.schedule_relationship = NEW / REPLACEMENT to specify new / replaced trips which do not run on a schedule from the GTFS static. #504**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/504)  
The updated proposal focuses on deprecating TripUpdate.schedule_relationship = ADDED in GTFS Realtime and using TripUpdate.schedule_relationship = NEW and  TripUpdate.schedule_relationship = REPLACEMENT to indicate a trip not found in GTFS Schedule, with the new value flagged as experimental.

## üìÇ Active Proposals

[**[Governance] New GTFS Schedule Governance Proposal #544**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/544)  
MobilityData is proposing an update to the current GTFS governance process based on two years of community feedback. Key improvements include clearer documentation, structured proposal phases, and revised voting requirements. 

* The discussion period was **extended by one additional month** to allow more time for review before proceeding to a vote.


[**[GTFS-Fares v2] Add Distance-Based Fares #556**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/556)  
This PR adds a new functionality to allow the modelling of Distance-based fare systems, by introducing multiple new fields on fare_leg_rules.txt and stop_times.txt as well as a new fare_leg_distance_rules.txt file.

[**Add cars_allowed field to trips.txt #547**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/547)  
This PR proposes adding a cars_allowed field to trips.txt. There was a lot of discussion in [issue #466](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/466) about how to add car information for ferries to GTFS. The discussion was centered around whether to use an approach with stop_times.txt or trips.txt. 

[**Add communication_period and impact_period #546**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/546)  
This proposal introduces two new fields: communication_period specifying the time that alerts should be displayed and impact_period to specify the time when the services are affected by the disruption. Additionally, it establishes rules to ensure these new fields are mutually exclusive with active_period for consistency.

[**Add cemv_support field in agency.txt and routes.txt #545**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/545)  
This proposal introduces a new cemv_support field in agency.txt and routes.txt to indicate if riders can use cEMV (contactless Europay, Mastercard, and Visa) to access a transit service under a specific agency or route. 

[**More clarifications on trip modifications #542**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/542)  
This proposal adds further clarification to trip modifications in GTFS Realtime regarding shapes, the use of IDs, and entity linking. It also aligns the definition of shape_id in TripProperties between the reference and the proto for consistency.

[**Enhancing GTFS Schedule and Realtime with original_trip_id #534**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/534)  
Davidr1234 suggests adopting `original_trip_id` from the Google Transit extension in both GTFS Schedule and GTFS Realtime. This would allow for seamless referencing of trips between GTFS and other standards, such as SIRI and NeTEx, which have a similar concept.

**Other open proposals:**

* [Fix typos in gtfs-realtime.proto #541](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/541)  
* [Introduce boarding permissions to specify the carriage of vehicles at per-stop granularity #533](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/533)  
* [Addition of event_based_trips.txt to specification #527](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/527)  
* [Add stops.stop_access field #515](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/515)  
* [Stop Time Events in the past should be kept #502](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/502)  
* [[GTFS Fares v2] Add nonconsecutive_transfer_allowed field and clarify fare_transfer_type #498](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/498)  
* [[GTFS Fares v2] Area Set matching predicates #483](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/483)  
* [Clarification of CANCELED/SKIPPED TripUpdates VS NO_SERVICE Alerts #482](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/482)  
* [[GTFS-Fares v2] Fare product/media transfer behavior #423](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/423) 

## üî• Most Active Conversations

[**Relax the requirement for in-seat transfer to allow attach / detaching vehicles in the middle of a trip #548**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/548)  
Michael questions the current requirement of in-seat transfers where carriages are attached / detached in the middle of a trip, which is common in the National Rail network. He proposes to relax the requirement of transfer_type = 4. 

[**Fares belong to multiple networks #551**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/551)  
Michael proposes to relax the requirement in route_networks.txt to allow a route to be assigned in multiple networks.

[**Defining fares which require transferring at certain stations within a general transfer network #555**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/555)  
Michael seeks guidance on modeling complex fare rules in GTFS Fares v2 for London's PAYG rail network.

[**Frequencies.txt primary key: add end_time, headway_secs & exact_times? #514**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/514)  
This issue proposes the extension of the primary key of frequencies.txt to cover trips with overlapping time windows and different headway_secs (such as additional bus services during rush hour) or different exact_times.

[**Expand / Add definition around route_type  #310**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/310)  
Elizabeth proposes the expansion of route_type in routes.txt by updateung bus and adding van and BRT.

[**Add cars_allowed field to trips.txt #466**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/466)  
Ville Pihlava proposes to add the car_allowed field to trips.txt to cover ferry and auto train use cases. 

[**Pluralized field names? #536**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/536)  
Nina questions why fields with a "Many" cardinality in GTFS are given singular rather than pluralized names. A response explains that since each row in a CSV contains only a single foreign key reference, the column name applies to the individual row rather than representing a collection.

[**Missing functionality to define "conceptual grouping of stops/stations" in existing GTFS #438**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/438)  
MobilityData proposes a [3-phase plan](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/438#issuecomment-2289511429) to improve station modeling, and would love to see any feedback on the plan. If there are no major objections, we will proceed with the first phase soon.
