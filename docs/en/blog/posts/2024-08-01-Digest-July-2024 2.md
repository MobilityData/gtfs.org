# [GTFS Digest] July 2024 - Stay Informed: 3 New Adoptions and a Vote to Watch

Key updates include the inclusion of shapes.txt for all route-based services (#470), clarification of stop_times.timepoint to mean no timepoint values are provided if empty (#474), and feed_info.txt updated to be Conditionally Required (#460). The community is voting on updates to stops.txt requirements for demand-responsive services (#472).

The GTFS Digest is a resource generated monthly by [MobilityData](https://mobilitydata.org/) providing an overview of developments on GTFS. 

We really value your feedback and would like to know how we did. We invite you to fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/GGefktvemnJD5Q9g8) and help us achieve the full potential of this tool. 


## üèÖ Contributor Shoutouts

**Stefan de Konink**

Shoutout for handling the conversation on [#481](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/481) like a champ. It‚Äôs not easy to juggle different viewpoints when proposing changes.

**Muhammed Yaseen & Amal**

Thank you for joining the GTFS community on Slack and asking valuable questions on resources that can help everyone. 

**Steve White & Jonathan McHatton**

Thank you for contributing on #gtfs-realtime. We are sure that the community will get back to you in no time and help you out in your inquiries. 

**Matt Caywood**

Your contribution on #gtfs-flex has not gone unnoticed! We are sure that you are not the only one asking [this question](https://mobilitydata-io.slack.com/archives/CSP7HDF37/p1721671741074589). 


## üöÄ Recently Adopted

**[Add that shapes should be included #470](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/470)**

This change adds a ‚Äúshould‚Äù statement in shapes.txt to specify that shapes.txt should be included for all route-based services, instead of making it recommended in all cases since zone-based demand-responsive services can now be modeled in GTFS.

**[Clarify intended use for timepoint in stop_times.txt #474](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/474)**

This change clarifies the empty semantics for stop_times.timepoint, specifying that an empty value means no timepoint values are provided for any record in stop_times.txt, and if provided, all records that have times associated should have timepoint values of 0 or 1.

**[Update requirement for feed_info.txt #460](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/460)**

This PR updates the presence description for feed_info.txt, to better align with the specification formatting and provide additional clarity on the requirement of the file, making it Conditionally Required.


## üó≥Ô∏è Currently Voting

**[Change stops.txt presence because of demand responsive services #472](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/472)**

This PR proposes to update the presence of stops.txt after the adoption of flex, changing it from Required to Conditionally Required (required if locations.geojson doesn't exist, optional otherwise).


## üìÇ Active Proposals

**[Add that headsigns are recommended #485](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/485)**

This PR proposes to add a statement that headsigns is recommended for all services with headsign text displayed on the vehicle which may be used to distinguish amongst trips in a route.

**[[GTFS Fares v2] Area Set matching predicates #483](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/483)**

In the current fare_leg_rules.txt, only origin and destination areas can be used as predicates, which cannot effectively describe some more complex zonal fare structures. This PR suggests adding collections of stop areas or ‚Äúarea sets‚Äù as predicates. \
 \
**[Clarification of CANCELED/SKIPPED TripUpdates VS NO_SERVICE Alerts #482](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/482)**

This PR proposes to clarify If an Alert with Effect.NO_SERVICE exists and conflicts with values in TripUpdates, Alerts should be considered the source of truth.

**[Add validity rules for polygons in locations.geojson #476](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/476)**

This PR proposes to refer to the OpenGIS Simple Features Specification, section 6.1.11 to improve the validity rules for flex polygons, instead  of describing all the ways in which polygons can be invalid in GTFS.

**Other open proposals:**



* [[GTFS-Fares v2] Add fare_leg_join_rules.txt (first iteration) #439](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/439)
* [Add Feed Version and GTFS url to the GTFS real time FeedHeader #434](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/434)
* [[GTFS-Fares v2] Fare product/media transfer behavior #423](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/423)<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span>



## üî• Most Active Conversations

**[Scheduled reinforcement trips #481](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/481)**

Stefan addresses the need for GTFS to support scheduled reinforcement trips that only become available in travel information services once confirmed by the operator, proposing an additional column in `trips.txt` to mark these trips, and discusses the limitations and potential solutions within existing GTFS and GTFS-RT frameworks.

**[Make headsigns a recommended GTFS field #480](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/480)**

This issue continues the discussion from #461 about the optional GTFS fields, proposing that the `trip_headsign` field should be recommended due to its widespread use and utility in production data, while considering potential challenges for routes without headsigns and exploring solutions such as a new `has_headsign` field to indicate the presence or absence of headsigns.

**[Center coordinate or Bounding box definition in feed_info.txt #471](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/471)**

Mustafa from Mathematician suggested adding fields in feed_info.txt that indicate a center point to focus on the area it represents on the map.

### Slack conversations on #gtfs-realtime

Connor Riley asks: [What is the best practice for taking those and generating vehicle and trip updates? Are there open source libraries for doing this? Are there any papers I should read?

Steve White inquires about stop time updates: [Do consumers also carry forward EARLY predicted arrivals to future stops? Or carry them forward until you get to a timepoint, and then assume the bus will hold to be back on time?](https://mobilitydata-io.slack.com/archives/C3D321CKB/p1721157182264069)
