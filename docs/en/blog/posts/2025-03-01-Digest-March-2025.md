# [GTFS Digest] March 2025 - Community Weighs In on Governance Proposal & Validator Release: Flex + Rider Categories

The March 2025 GTFS Digest highlights the community review of the GTFS Schedule Governance Proposal and the release of GTFS Validator v7.0, now supporting full Flex validation rules and Rider Categories for GTFS-Fares v2. Two votes are underway: updates to demand-responsive transit (DRT) and deprecating TripUpdate.schedule_relationship = ADDED. Active proposals include cEMV contactless payment support and car ferry allowances.

## üèÖ Contributor Shoutouts

**Felix G√ºndling**  
Thank you for your impactful contributions to specification discussions and for joining the Fares v2 working group meetings!

**Niko Rekhviashvili**  
Welcome to the GTFS community. We are glad to have you with us. 

**Andrew Byrd, Guillaume Campagna, Paul Schwartz, Weston Shippy, Adriana Ceric, & Mike Gilligan**   
We would like to extend the sincere gratitude to all of you that have taken the time to review the GTFS Schedule Governance proposal. 

## üó≥Ô∏è Currently Voting

[**Clarification on continuous pickup/dropoff value and field Type in booking_rules.txt #528**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/528)  
This PR introduces clarifications specifically for demand-responsive transportation (DRT) services, allowing a value of 1 for continuous_pickup/continuous_drop_off when start_pickup_drop_off_window/end_pickup_drop_off_window are indicated.

[**Deprecate TripUpdate.schedule_relationship = ADDED, add TripUpdate.schedule_relationship = NEW / REPLACEMENT to specify new / replaced trips which do not run on a schedule from the GTFS static. #504**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/504)  
The updated proposal focuses on deprecating TripUpdate.schedule_relationship = ADDED in GTFS Realtime and using TripUpdate.schedule_relationship = NEW and  TripUpdate.schedule_relationship = REPLACEMENT to indicate a trip not found in GTFS Schedule, with the new value flagged as experimental.

## üìÇ Active Proposals

[**Add cars_allowed field to trips.txt #547**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/547)  
This PR proposes adding a cars_allowed field to trips.txt. There was a lot of discussion in [issue #466](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/466) about how to add car information for ferries to GTFS. The discussion was centered around whether to use an approach with stop_times.txt or trips.txt. 

[**Add communication_period and impact_period #546**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/546)  
This proposal introduces two new fields: communication_period specifying the time that alerts should be displayed and impact_period to specify the time when the services are affected by the disruption. Additionally, it establishes rules to ensure these new fields are mutually exclusive with active_period for consistency.

[**Add cemv_support field in agency.txt and routes.txt #545**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/545)  
This proposal introduces a new cemv_support field in agency.txt and routes.txt to indicate if riders can use cEMV (contactless Europay, Mastercard, and Visa) to access a transit service under a specific agency or route. 

[**[Governance] New GTFS Schedule Governance Proposal #544**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/544)  
MobilityData is proposing an update to the current GTFS governance process based on two years of community feedback. Key improvements include clearer documentation, structured proposal phases, and revised voting requirements. Now, we‚Äôre inviting final discussions before calling a vote to adopt these changes.

* The discussion and review period should last until mid-april.  

[**More clarifications on trip modifications #542**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/542)  
This proposal adds further clarification to trip modifications in GTFS Realtime regarding shapes, the use of IDs, and entity linking. It also aligns the definition of shape_id in TripProperties between the reference and the proto for consistency.

[**Enhancing GTFS Schedule and Realtime with original_trip_id #534**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/534)  
Davidr1234 suggests adopting `original_trip_id` from the Google Transit extension in both GTFS Schedule and GTFS Realtime. This would allow for seamless referencing of trips between GTFS and other standards, such as SIRI and NeTEx, which have a similar concept.

**Other open proposals:**

* [Fix typos in gtfs-realtime.proto #541](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/541)  
* [Introduce boarding permissions to specify the carriage of vehicles at per-stop granularity #533](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/533)  
* [Addition of event_based_trips.txt to specification #527](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/527)  
* [Add stops.stop_access field #515](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/515)  
* [Stop Time Events in the past should be kept #502](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/502)  
* [[GTFS Fares v2] Add nonconsecutive_transfer_allowed field and clarify fare_transfer_type #498](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/498)  
* [[GTFS Fares v2] Area Set matching predicates #483](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/483)  
* [Clarification of CANCELED/SKIPPED TripUpdates VS NO_SERVICE Alerts #482](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/482)  
* [[GTFS-Fares v2] Fare product/media transfer behavior #423](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/423) 

## üî• Most Active Conversations

[**Relax the requirement for in-seat transfer to allow attach / detaching vehicles in the middle of a trip #548**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/548)  
Michael questions the current requirement of in-seat transfers where carriages are attached / detached in the middle of a trip, which is common in the National Rail network. He proposes to relax the requirement of transfer_type = 4. 

[**Best Practices: Reasonable lengths in unique ids #518**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/518)  
Stefan proposes to introduce a best practice that sets a recommended character limit for any ID used in a GTFS feed, triggering a validator warning if a value exceeds 36 bytes.

[**Pluralized field names? #536**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/536)  
Nina questions why fields with a "Many" cardinality in GTFS are given singular rather than pluralized names. A response explains that since each row in a CSV contains only a single foreign key reference, the column name applies to the individual row rather than representing a collection.
