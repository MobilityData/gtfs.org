## üöÄ Recently Adopted

[**Adjustment to trip modifications #497**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/497)  
This PR clarifies the GTFS Realtime documentation regarding Trip Modifications, adding support for frequency based services, adding missing extensions fields in the .proto file and making documentation more comprehensive and consistent across different files.

## üìÇ Active Proposals

[**[GTFS Fares v2] Add rider_categories.txt #511**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/511)  
The rider_categories.txt file is part of the GTFS-Fares v2 proposal, aimed at modeling rider categories that are eligible for certain fares.

[**Add stops.stop_access field #515**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/515)  
This PR adds a stop_access field in stops.txt to indicate how the stop is accessed for a particular station. Please refer to [this proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1huTq9I6Bs38ZGtcG-7Cpns0kT1njV3PoUCjnjEE0Y1E/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.4jjq7xol2izb) for details.

[**Specify the behaviour of TripUpdate.schedule_relationship = ADDED, and un-deprecate REPLACEMENT #504**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/504)  
This PR specifies the behavior of ADDED, and un-deprecate REPLACEMENT, based on the implementation of OpenTripPlanner which specifies the whole journey to be added or replaced. Additional fields, such as headsigns, and pickup / drop-off types, are introduced as required to support the full specification of completely new trips.
