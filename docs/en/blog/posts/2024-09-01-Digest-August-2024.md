## üì¢ Announcements

[**GTFS.org had a facelift**](http://GTFS.org)  
We‚Äôve been hard at work gathering feedback and working to make GTFS.org the only place you need to visit for everything GTFS.

Whether you‚Äôre new to the transit specification or a seasoned GTFS veteran, GTFS.org has everything you need.

Here are some of the changes you can expect to see during your first visit:

* New design and navigation to better guide visitors.   
* A Getting Started section highlighting the basics of GTFS and its Features.   
* A Community Section to help you get involved in the development of GTFS   
* [**The new home of the GTFS Digest in the Blog Section**](https://gtfs.org/blog/).

## üöÄ Recently Adopted

[**Change stops.txt presence because of demand responsive services #472**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/472)  
This PR proposes to update the presence of stops.txt after the adoption of flex, changing it from Required to Conditionally Required (required if locations.geojson doesn't exist, optional otherwise).

[**Add that headsigns are recommended #485**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/485)  
This PR proposes to add a statement that headsigns is recommended for all services with headsign text displayed on the vehicle which may be used to distinguish amongst trips in a route.

## üó≥Ô∏è Currently Voting

[**Add validity rules for polygons in locations.geojson #476**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/476)  
This PR proposes to refer to the OpenGIS Simple Features Specification, section 6.1.11 to improve the validity rules for flex polygons, instead  of describing all the ways in which polygons can be invalid in GTFS.

* *The voting period ends on Wednesday, September 11, 2024 at 23:59:59 UTC*.

[**[Clarification] from/to_stop_id & from/to_trip_id description in transfers.txt**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/455)  
This PR clarifies the description of from/to_stop_id and from/to_trip_id in transfers.txt without changing the original semantics.

* *The voting period ends on Tuesday, September 17, 2024 at 23:59:59 UTC.*

## üìÇ Active Proposals

[**[GTFS Fares v2] Area Set matching predicates #483**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/483)  
In the current fare_leg_rules.txt, only origin and destination areas can be used as predicates, which cannot effectively describe some more complex zonal fare structures. This PR suggests adding collections of stop areas or ‚Äúarea sets‚Äù as predicates.

[**Clarification of CANCELED/SKIPPED TripUpdates VS NO_SERVICE Alerts #482**](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/482)  
This is a heavily debated proposal. Contributors are currently debating:

* Whether NO_SERVICE alerts can be used for routing or are only meant to provide messages.  
* Whether the specification allows for different interpretations among consumers.

**Other open proposals:**

* [[GTFS-Fares v2] Add fare_leg_join_rules.txt (first iteration) #439](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/439)  
* [Add Feed Version and GTFS url to the GTFS real time FeedHeader #434](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/434)  
* [[GTFS-Fares v2] Fare product/media transfer behavior #423](https://github.com/google/transit/pull/423) 

## üî• Most Active Conversations

[**Allow specifying both the scheduled time and delay in StopTimeEvent for added and duplicated trips. #490**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/490)  
miklcct proposed updating the GTFS-RT spec to allow specifying both scheduled time and delay in StopTimeEvent for ADDED and DUPLICATED trips. This change would address issues with current limitations that prevent indicating scheduled times for these types of trips, especially in ad hoc or duplicated services. The proposal aims to maintain compatibility with existing systems while enhancing flexibility.

[**Have a way to explicitly communicate that a trip does not have any headsigns #488**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/488)  
evansiroky proposed to adjust the specification writing to include an explicit statement that indicates that if no headsign is provided, then it should be assumed that the vehicle does not feature a headsign.

[**It is impossible to specify a different arrival_time and departure_time in a GTFS-RT trip modification object #487**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/487)  
Miklcct proposes to add a layover field in the ReplacementStop object to specify the duration of an extended stop at a station for vehicles on a detour journey.

[**Scheduled reinforcement trips #481**](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/481)  
Stefan addresses the need for GTFS to support scheduled reinforcement trips that only become available in travel information services once confirmed by the operator, proposing an additional column in `trips.txt` to mark these trips, and discusses the limitations and potential solutions within existing GTFS and GTFS-RT frameworks.
