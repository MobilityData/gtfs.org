# The GTFS Digest has been released

GTFS Contributors, Itâ€™s finally here! ðŸŽ‰

Following extensive community outreach and the recent MobilityData workshops in Valencia and New York, we've heeded your advice and proudly present the GTFS Digest. The Digest is a part of Phase 1 of Modifications to the GTFS Governance: Phasing Plan #413. We hope it will help reduce the barriers to entry for new and returning GTFS contributors by keeping them up to speed.
