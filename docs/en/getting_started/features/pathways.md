#  Pathways
Pathways features can model large transit stations, guiding riders from station entrances and exists to the location where they board or disambark from a transit vehicle. Some of these features make it possible to communicate a path's physical characteristics and estimated navigation time, and real-world wayfinding systems employed in stations.

## Pathway Connections

At its foundational level, Pathways offers basic functionality to connect key areas defined in Location types within a station. These connections form pathways, enabling users to obtain precise directions (e. g. from an entrance to the boarding area), which is particularly useful in navigating large and complex transit stations.

## Pathway Details

More details can be added regarding the physical characteristics of a stationâ€™s pathways, including length, width and slope (for ramps) or the number of stairs (for stairways). This helps riders anticipate the conditions and accessibility of the pathway they need to navigate.

## Levels

Levels can be used to list all different levels within a station, providing users with an additional layer of information to stations. This feature also enables the use of elevators in conjunction with the Pathways connections feature.

## In-station Traversal Time

In-station Traversal Time provides an additional level of detail to in-station directions, giving users an estimated time required to navigate stations, resulting in better travel directions and travel times.

## Pathway Signs

Pathway Signs can bridge the information displayed in trip planners with real-world signs. If this is represented in a feed, trip planners can provide directions such as 'follow signs to '.
