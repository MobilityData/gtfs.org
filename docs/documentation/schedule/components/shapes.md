# Shapes

Shapes can be defined and associated with trips, enabling trip planning applications to display trips on a map and inform riders of the distance they need to travel in a transit vehicle. The `shape_dist_traveled` fields are used to programmatically determine how much of a shape to draw when showing a map to riders.
When defining shapes, there is a balance between their level of detail (e.g. following the exact curvature of roads) and conveying only the necessary information efficiently.
