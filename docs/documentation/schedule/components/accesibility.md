# Accessibility
GTFS contains multiple features intended to assist riders in navigating and accessing public transit services. Such features can communicate route names and colors consistent with the agency's rider-facing materials, indicate wheelchair accessibility for stops or entire trips, or ensure accurate information for riders using assistive technology.

## Wheelchair accessibility

Wheelchair accessibility fields make it possible to indicate if a stop and vehicle can accommodate users using wheelchairs, allowing them to plan their trips based on the most convenient option for their needs.
