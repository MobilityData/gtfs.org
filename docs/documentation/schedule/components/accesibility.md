# Accessibility Component
The Accessibility Component of GTFS contains multiple functionalities to provide information that helps end users navigate and access public transit services. Some of these features can be used to communicate the name and color of a route, confirm whether or not a trip and a station are wheelchair accessible, or providing translations in multiple languages.

## Text-to-speech

<div class="grid" markdown>

This feature allows to provide the necessary inputs to convert text into audio, making it possible to communicate transit information, such as stop names, in a more inclusive format.

## Wheelchair accessibility
