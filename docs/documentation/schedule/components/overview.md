# GTFS Components

As the GTFS Specification grows and adapts to the current needs of transit systems to accurately and effectively communicate service information, the functions of the specification can become increasingly complex. **GTFS Components** are intended to offer a clear and definitive definition of functionalities that are enabled by the GTFS Schedule specification, helping transit agencies, vendors, consumers and researchers to answer the question: **What can I do with GTFS?** 

The following groups of features, called Components, explain the purpose of each feature as well as the files and fields associated with them, helping users to understand which data is needed in order to support a specific feature.


## Base
The features included in this component provide the most basic and essential elements that a GTFS needs to represent a transit service. This includes entries for each individual trip, stop, arrival and departure times and service days among many other important pieces of information. Since all of the features included in the base component are essential to enable a working GTFS feed, all these features must be implemented together.

## Accessibility
The Accessibility Component of GTFS contains multiple functionalities to provide information that helps end users navigate and access public transit services. Some of these features can be used to communicate the name and color of a route, confirm whether or not a trip and a station are wheelchair accessible, or providing translations in multiple languages.

##  Pathways
The Pathways component contains features that allow the modeling of in-station, helping users navigate transit stations from beginning to end and across multiple levels. Some of these features make it possible to communicate the physical characteristics of each individual section of a path, estimate the time required to navigate them and to match this navigation information with the real-world wayfinding systems used in stations.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

</div>


## Metadata
The Metadata Component contains features providing further information regarding the producer of the GTFS feed and the feed itself. This includes the names of the organizations as well as contact information.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-subway-variant:{ .lg .middle } __Feed Information__

    Communicate information regarding the feed itself

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn more about this feature](/schedule/components/metadata/#feed-information)
    

-   :material-subway-variant:{ .lg .middle } __Attributions__

    Communicate who was involved in the creation of the dataset

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn more about this feature](/schedule/components/metadata/#attributions)

</div>


## Flexible services
This component contains features that make it possible to communicate service information for flexible services with special operations that might not follow the common behavior of scheduled and/or fixed  services.


<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-subway-variant:{ .lg .middle } __Continuous stops__

    Indicate if a user can be picked up and/or dropped off between stops
    
    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn more about this feature](/schedule/components/flexible_services/#continuous-stops)
    
</div>



## Shapes
The Shapes component and feature communicates the path a vehicle follows along a route. This allows trip planning applications to display the path of a trip so users have a clear understanding of where the route operates in relation to their travel needs.


<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-subway-variant:{ .lg .middle } __Shapes__

    Define the geographic path followed by a vehicle along a trip
    
    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn more about this feature](/schedule/components/shapes)
    
</div>



## Transfers
The transfers component and feature allowes the description of transfers between different public transit services. This gives transit agencies the ability to clearly define the applicable rules for each transfer scenario, so that travelers can know if itâ€™s possible to connect trips.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-subway-variant:{ .lg .middle } __Transfers__

    Describe transfers allowed between different transit services

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn more about this feature](/schedule/components/transfers)
    
</div>




## Frequency-based services
The frequencies component and feature can be used to represent frequency-based trips (e.g. a bus trips running every 10 minutes, a subway or metro service running every 2 minutes). This can be a useful alternative to providing specific timetables, acting as an alternative to some of the information included in the stop times Feature of the Base Component. 

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-subway-variant:{ .lg .middle } __Frequencies__

    Represent stop times based on headways or frequencies
    
    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn more about this feature](/schedule/components/frequency_based_services)
    
</div>
