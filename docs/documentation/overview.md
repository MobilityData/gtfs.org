# General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)

The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is an [Open Standard](https://www.interoperablemobility.org/definitions/#open_standard) used to distribute relevant information about transit systems to riders. It allows public transit agencies to publish their transit data in a format that can be consumed by a wide variety of software applications.

GTFS consists of two main parts: [GTFS Schedule](./schedule/reference.md) and [GTFS Realtime](./Realtime/reference.md).

## [GTFS Schedule](./schedule/reference.md)

GTFS Schedule is a feed specification that defines a common format for static public transportation information. It is composed of a number of text (.txt) files that are contained in a single ZIP file. Each file describes a particular aspect of transit information: stops, routes, trips, fares, etc.

## [GTFS Realtime](./Realtime/reference.md)

GTFS Realtime is a feed specification that allows public transportation agencies to provide up-to-date information about current arrival and departure times, service alerts, and vehicle position, allowing users to smoothly plan their trips.
