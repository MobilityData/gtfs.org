# Frequency-based services Component & Feature

<div class="grid" markdown>

The frequencies component and feature can be used to represent frequency-based trips (e.g. a bus trips running every 10 minutes, a subway or metro service running every 2 minutes), this can be a useful alternative to providing specific timetables, acting as an alternative to some of the information included in the stop times Feature of the Base Component.
