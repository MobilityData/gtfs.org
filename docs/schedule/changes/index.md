# GTFS Schedule Changes

<!-- <div class=landing-page>
    <a class=button href=../process>Specification Amendment Process</a><a class=button href=../guiding-principles>Guiding Principles</a><a class=button href=../revision-history>Revision History</a>
</div> -->

The GTFS Specification is not set in stone. Instead, it is an open specification developed and maintained by the community of transit agencies, developers, and other stakeholders who use GTFS. It is expected that this community of producers and consumers of GTFS data will have proposals for extending the spec to enable new capabilities.

To contribute to GTFS, read the [Specification Amendment Process](../process) and follow the discussions in the open <a href="https://github.com/google/transit/issues" target="_blank">issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/google/transit/pulls" target="_blank">pull requests</a> on Google's Transit Github repository (<a href="https://github.com/google/transit" target="_blank">google/transit</a>). ![](../../assets/mark-github.svg)

!!! note ""

	The official specification, reference and documentation are written in English. If a translation to a different language differs from the English original, the latter takes precedence. All communication is performed in English.
