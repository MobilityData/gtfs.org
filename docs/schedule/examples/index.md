# GTFS Schedule Examples

To help in understanding the GTFS specification and in producing tools that read and write GTFS data, take a look at the following examples of GTFS feeds:

- The [Example GTFS Feed page](/schedule/example-feed) provides a simple GTFS feed that can be used as a model to understand how a GTFS feed is put together.
- Examples by use case:
    - [Routes, stops, and trips](routes-stops-trips)
    - [Continuous stops](continuous-stops)
    - [Text-to-speech](text-to-speech)
    - [Fares v1](fares-v1)
    - [Fares v2](fares-v2)
    - [Frequencies](frequencies)
    - [Pathways](pathways)
    - [Translations](translations)
    - [Feed information](feed-info)
    - [Dataset attributions](attributions)
    - [Demand responsive services](flex)
- See the [Mobility Database](https://database.mobilitydata.org/) and [Transitland](https://www.transit.land/) for public feeds from real transit agencies.
