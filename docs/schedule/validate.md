# GTFS Schedule Validator

This free and open-source canonical GTFS Schedule validator is maintained by [MobilityData](https://mobilitydata.org) with the help of the GTFS community. Use it to evaluate your dataset against the official [GTFS Reference](reference.md) and [Best Practices](best-practices.md). It provides an easy-to-use validation report in an HTML format that can be opened in the browser and shared with other parties.
