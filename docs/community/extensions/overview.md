# Extensions

<!-- GTFS is a community driven data format. Users can propose and vote on changes. For detailed information see the [GTFS Schedule](../schedule/process) and [GTFS Realtime](../realtime/process) amendment process.

Extensions that are currently in development can be found on MobilityData's [roadmap](https://mobilitydata.org/roadmaps/#transit).

Extension proposals can be found in the following places:

- MobilityData maintains a [portal with a list of GTFS extension proposals](https://mobilitydata.org/roadmaps/#transit). The roadmap is based on their members' prioritization. You can contribute ideas or extensions via the portal.
- TransitWiki.org contains a [list GTFS extension projects](https://www.transitwiki.org/TransitWiki/index.php/General_Transit_Feed_Specification#GTFS_Extensions).

For more information, contact [specifications@mobilitydata.org](mailto:specifications@mobilitydata.org) -->

=== "GTFS Schedule"

    Additional files and fields can be extended onto GTFS Schedule datasets to accommodate a variety of application-specific needs communicated between transit agencies and software vendors, even if these fields are not in the [official specification](../../../documentation/schedule/reference). 
    
    Below is a list of GTFS Schedule extensions that may be implemented.
    
    !!! info "Making an extension official in the specification" 

        Extensions may become active proposals and subsequently [merged](../../../documentation/schedule/recent additions/#recently-merged-proposals) into the official specification via the [Specification Amendment Process](../../community/spec_amendment_process/gtfs_schedule_amendment_process.md).
