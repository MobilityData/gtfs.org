## Active projects

The community is constantly developing new additions to the specification that could require discussions and working group meetings to accomplish their larger goals in an open source setting. Working group meetings are consensus building discussions led by a facilitator, and attended by developpers, and interested contributors.   

### GTFS-Fares v2
GTFS-Fares v2 aims at improving the current Fares representation in GTFS by introducing new features like: fare products, rider categories, fare media, and more. These concepts will allow data producers to model different fare structures such as: zone-based, time-based, and inter-agency fares.
