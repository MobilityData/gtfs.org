## GTFS Governance

The GTFS Specification is not set in stone. Instead, it is an open specification developed and maintained by the community of transit agencies, developers, and other stakeholders who use GTFS. It is expected that this community of producers and consumers of GTFS data will have proposals for extending the spec to enable new capabilities.

To formalize this process, we've established the GTFS Governance framework, which includes the Specification Amendment Process.

## Active projects

The community is constantly developing new additions to the specification that could require discussions and working group meetings to accomplish their larger goals in an open source setting. Working group meetings are consensus building discussions led by a facilitator, and attended by developpers, and interested contributors.
