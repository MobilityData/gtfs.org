# GTFS-Flex

Flex is a GTFS Schedule extension project that aims to facilitate discoverability of Demand Responsive Transportation Services.

ü§î Services like dial-a-ride are often brushed over by riders, who sometimes have no clue they even exist. This lack of accessibility is an issue for transit agencies, trip planners, and riders. Imagine a group of tourists arriving at your local airport who would like to reach a rural area that only offers an on-demand bus service. The tourists check their preferred trip planner app and do not find a viable public transportation option. They end up renting a car. Being tourists, they miss all of your paper flyers posted along the hallway announcing the on-demand service. Not only is your service underused, but it lacks the discoverability to meet current and future rider demand. This is where GTFS-Flex comes in. GTFS-Flex helps riders discover your service, so they enjoy the services you worked hard to promote.

üîÆ MobilityData expects GTFS-Flex to open the door to deeper standardization of demand responsive transportation, including expansion into transactional and real-time components using GTFS-OnDemand. We are preparing a suggested strategy to best handle the growing number of modes of transportation and complexity of concepts in this area.

## GTFS-Flex: Service Discovery
MobilityData has opened an issue to cover the service discovery of GTFS-Flex. Using this incremental approach should allow us to better establish a strong base for consensus.

üî≠ Scope of GTFS-Flex: Service Discovery

Based on what has already been tested in the field, we see GTFS-Flex solving the following key use cases:

- Display available demand responsive transportation services for rider discovery
- Deviated bus routes
- Dial-a-ride (e.g Rufbus, On-call bus)
- Displaying contact information (phone number and/or website URL) for booking

## Glossary

üì≤ Dial-a-ride is a variation of multiple terms used across Europe. 

üá®üá≠ In Switzerland, it would fall under the term Rufbus / On-call bus. There's also the availability of the [PubliCar system by PostAuto](https://www.postauto.ch/en/timetable-and-network/publicar). Under this proposal, the PubliCar App and service would be discoverable in the user‚Äôs preferred trip planner app. 

üá¶üáπ In Austria, dial-a-ride would also be Rufbus and under the bigger umbrella of Bedarfsverkehr (Demand Responsive Transport) and Mikro-√ñV (Microtransit).

- flextur (english: flex trip)
- formerly flextrafik (english: flex transit)

üá´üá∑ ‚ö†Ô∏è In France ‚ÄúParatransit‚Äù is used to describe ‚Äúinformal‚Äù transit (instead of on-demand transit for people with disabilities)

üá¨üáß In the United Kingdom, there is the following service:

- [go2 Sevenoaks](https://www.go-coach.co.uk/go2/ )
- On-demand service

The terminology varies across borders but in general we can assume that dial-a-ride is any demand responsive service that requires some form of contact by the rider to the operator.
