# GTFS-Flex

Flex is a GTFS Schedule extension project that aims to facilitate discoverability of Demand Responsive Transportation Services.

ðŸ¤” As many of you know, services like paratransit and on-demand rides are often brushed over by riders, who sometimes have no clue they even exist. This lack of accessibility is an issue for producers, consumers, and riders. Imagine a group of tourists arriving at your local airport and would like to reach a rural area that does not offer scheduled bus routes but only an on-demand bus service. The tourists check their preferred trip planner app and do not find a viable public transportation option; they end up renting a car. Being tourists, they missed all of your paper flyers posted along the hallway announcing the on-demand service. Not only is your service underutilized, but it lacks the discoverability to meet current and future rider demand. This is where GTFS-Flex comes in by providing that information to the rider allowing them to enjoy the services you worked hard to promote.
