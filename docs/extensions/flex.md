# GTFS-Flex

Flex is a GTFS Schedule extension project that aims to facilitate discoverability of Demand Responsive Transportation Services.

ðŸ¤” As many of you know, services like dial-a-ride are often brushed over by riders, who sometimes have no clue they even exist. This lack of accessibility is an issue for producers, consumers, and riders. Imagine a group of tourists arriving at your local airport and would like to reach a rural area that does not offer scheduled bus routes but only an on-demand bus service. The tourists check their preferred trip planner app and do not find a viable public transportation option; they end up renting a car. Being tourists, they missed all of your paper flyers posted along the hallway announcing the on-demand service. Not only is your service underutilized, but it lacks the discoverability to meet current and future rider demand. This is where GTFS-Flex comes in by providing that information to the rider allowing them to enjoy the services you worked hard to promote.

ðŸ”® MobilityData expects GTFS-Flex to open the door to deeper standardization of demand responsive transportation including expansion into transactional and real-time components using GTFS-OnDemand. We are preparing a suggested strategy to best handle the growing number of modes of transportation and complexity of concepts engaging in this area.

## WIP: Base Implementation
We have opened an issue to cover the base implementation of GTFS-Flex. Using this incremental approach should allow us to better establish a strong base for consensus.

ðŸ”­ Scope of GTFS-Flex: Base Implementation

Based on what has already been tested in the field, we see GTFS-Flex solving the following key use cases:

- Display available demand responsive transportation services for rider discovery
- Deviated bus routes
- Dial-a-ride (e.g Rufbus, On-call bus)
- Displaying contact information (phone number and/or website URL) for booking
