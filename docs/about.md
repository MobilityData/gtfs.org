## How can I contribute to gtfs.org?

**Submit an issue or a content addition idea**

The more ideas, the merrier! If you have an idea for how to improve GTFS.org's content or user experience design, open an [issue](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs.org/issues/new) on the GTFS.org repository.

**Suggest a change with a Pull Request**

To propose edits to the content, navigate to the page you want to change on [GTFS.org](https://gtfs.org/) and click on the "Edit this page" icon on the top-right of the page. The "Edit this page" icon will direct you to an editable page on the appropriate Github repository. You can then submit your edits as a pull request. üìù

**Contributing translations**

GTFS.org uses [Simpleen](https://simpleen.io/), an automated machine learning translation tool, to ensure translations are kept up to date with repository changes. Since our priority is to keep translations up-to-date, any one-time translation contributions will be overwritten by Simpleen in the future.

We do accept glossary changes. Simpleen uses a glossary for key terms that are commonly used across GTFS.org, like trip or station. If you want to suggest a translation for a key term that should be applied across the entire site, you can [create an issue on the GTFS.org repository](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs.org/issues/new/choose).
