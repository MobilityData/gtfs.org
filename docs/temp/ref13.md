Primary key (`stop_id`)

|  Field Name | Type | Presence | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  `stop_id` | Unique ID | **Required** | Identifies a location: stop/platform, station, entrance/exit, generic node or boarding area (see `location_type`). <br><br>Multiple routes may use the same `stop_id`. |
|  `stop_code` | Text | Optional | Short text or a number that identifies the location for riders. These codes are often used in phone-based transit information systems or printed on signage to make it easier for riders to get information for a particular location. The `stop_code` may be the same as `stop_id` if it is public facing. This field should be left empty for locations without a code presented to riders. |
|  `stop_name` | Text | **Conditionally Required** | Name of the location. The `stop_name` should match the agency's rider-facing name for the location as printed on a timetable, published online, or represented on signage. For translations into other languages, use `translations.txt`.<br><br>When the location is a boarding area (`location_type=4`), the `stop_name` should contains the name of the boarding area as displayed by the agency. It could be just one letter (like on some European intercity railway stations), or text like “Wheelchair boarding area” (NYC’s Subway) or “Head of short trains” (Paris’ RER).<br><br>Conditionally Required:<br>- **Required** for locations which are stops (`location_type=0`), stations (`location_type=1`) or entrances/exits (`location_type=2`).<br>- Optional for locations which are generic nodes (`location_type=3`) or boarding areas (`location_type=4`).|
|  `tts_stop_name` | Text | Optional | Readable version of the `stop_name`. See "Text-to-speech field" in the [Term Definitions](#term-definitions) for more. |
|  `stop_desc` | Text | Optional | Description of the location that provides useful, quality information. Should not be a duplicate of `stop_name`.|
|  `stop_lat` | Latitude | **Conditionally Required** | Latitude of the location.<br><br>For stops/platforms (`location_type=0`) and boarding area (`location_type=4`), the coordinates must be the ones of the bus pole — if exists — and otherwise of where the travelers are boarding the vehicle (on the sidewalk or the platform, and not on the roadway or the track where the vehicle stops). <br><br>Conditionally Required:<br>- **Required** for locations which are stops (`location_type=0`), stations (`location_type=1`) or entrances/exits (`location_type=2`).<br>- Optional for locations which are generic nodes (`location_type=3`) or boarding areas (`location_type=4`).|
|  `stop_lon` | Longitude | **Conditionally Required** | Longitude of the location.<br><br>For stops/platforms (`location_type=0`) and boarding area (`location_type=4`), the coordinates must be the ones of the bus pole — if exists — and otherwise of where the travelers are boarding the vehicle (on the sidewalk or the platform, and not on the roadway or the track where the vehicle stops). <br><br>Conditionally Required:<br>- **Required** for locations which are stops (`location_type=0`), stations (`location_type=1`) or entrances/exits (`location_type=2`).<br>- Optional for locations which are generic nodes (`location_type=3`) or boarding areas (`location_type=4`). |
|  `zone_id` | ID | **Conditionally Required** | Identifies the fare zone for a stop. If this record represents a station or station entrance, the `zone_id` is ignored.<br><br>Conditionally Required:<br>- **Required** if providing fare information using [fare_rules.txt](#fare_rulestxt) <br>- Optional otherwise.|
|  `stop_url` | URL | Optional | URL of a web page about the location. This should be different from the `agency.agency_url` and the `routes.route_url` field values. |
|  `location_type` | Enum | Optional | Location type. Valid options are:<br><br>`0` (or blank) - **Stop** (or **Platform**). A location where passengers board or disembark from a transit vehicle. Is called a platform when defined within a `parent_station`.<br>`1` - **Station**. A physical structure or area that contains one or more platform.<br>`2` - **Entrance/Exit**. A location where passengers can enter or exit a station from the street. If an entrance/exit belongs to multiple stations, it may be linked by pathways to both, but the data provider must pick one of them as parent.<br>`3` - **Generic Node**. A location within a station, not matching any other `location_type`, that may be used to link together pathways define in pathways.txt.<br>`4` - **Boarding Area**. A specific location on a platform, where passengers can board and/or alight vehicles.|
|  `parent_station` | Foreign ID referencing `stops.stop_id` | **Conditionally Required** | Defines hierarchy between the different locations defined in `stops.txt`. It contains the ID of the parent location, as followed:<br><br>- **Stop/platform** (`location_type=0`): the `parent_station` field contains the ID of a station.<br>- **Station** (`location_type=1`): this field must be empty.<br>- **Entrance/exit** (`location_type=2`) or **generic node** (`location_type=3`): the `parent_station` field contains the ID of a station (`location_type=1`)<br>- **Boarding Area** (`location_type=4`): the `parent_station` field contains ID of a platform.<br><br>Conditionally Required:<br>- **Required** for locations which are entrances (`location_type=2`), generic nodes (`location_type=3`) or boarding areas (`location_type=4`).<br>- Optional for stops/platforms (`location_type=0`).<br>- Forbidden for stations (`location_type=1`).|
|  `stop_timezone` | Timezone | Optional | Timezone of the location. If the location has a parent station, it inherits the parent station’s timezone instead of applying its own. Stations and parentless stops with empty `stop_timezone` inherit the timezone specified by `agency.agency_timezone`. If `stop_timezone` values are provided, the times in [stop_times.txt](#stop_timetxt) should be entered as the time since midnight in the timezone specified by `agency.agency_timezone`. This ensures that the time values in a trip always increase over the course of a trip, regardless of which timezones the trip crosses. |
|  `wheelchair_boarding` | Enum | Optional | Indicates whether wheelchair boardings are possible from the location. Valid options are: <br><br>For parentless stops:<br>`0` or empty - No accessibility information for the stop.<br>`1` - Some vehicles at this stop can be boarded by a rider in a wheelchair.<br>`2` - Wheelchair boarding is not possible at this stop. <br><br>For child stops: <br>`0` or empty - Stop will inherit its `wheelchair_boarding` behavior from the parent station, if specified in the parent.<br>`1` - There exists some accessible path from outside the station to the specific stop/platform.<br>`2` - There exists no accessible path from outside the station to the specific stop/platform.<br><br> For station entrances/exits: <br>`0` or empty - Station entrance will inherit its `wheelchair_boarding` behavior from the parent station, if specified for the parent.<br>`1` - Station entrance is wheelchair accessible.<br>`2` - No accessible path from station entrance to stops/platforms. |
|  `level_id` | Foreign ID referencing `levels.level_id` | Optional | Level of the location. The same level may be used by multiple unlinked stations.|
|  `platform_code` | Text | Optional | Platform identifier for a platform stop (a stop belonging to a station). This should be just the platform identifier (eg. "G" or "3"). Words like “platform” or "track" (or the feed’s language-specific equivalent) should not be included. This allows feed consumers to more easily internationalize and localize the platform identifier into other languages. |
